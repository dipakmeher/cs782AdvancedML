-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
 
3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
 
4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

# Note: Do not extract entities from the examples below; these are provided for learning purposes only. Extract entities only from the actual input text.

Entity_types: ORGANIZATION, PERSON, GOVERNMENT_AGENCY, MEANS_OF_TRANSPORTATION, UNDOCUMENTED_NON-CITIZEN, DRIVER, ROUTES, MEANS_OF_COMMUNICATION, FEES
Text:
The Crimson Cartel, an organized smuggling network, operates through a vast network of routes, including desert paths, to transport undocumented non-citizens across borders. The group relies on trucks and boats to carry individuals undetected. Ricardo Perez, a driver employed by the cartel, coordinates closely with Jorge Rivera, a senior leader in the cartel, to manage these operations. Reports suggest encrypted messaging apps are used to ensure communication remains secure. Authorities, including the Federal Border Agency, have intercepted several smuggling operations by the cartel. The cartel is known to charge $5,000 per migrant for illegal transportation services.

Text:
On August 20, 2023, the Shadow Syndicate, a well-known smuggling organization, orchestrated the illegal transport of Mexican nationals alongside cocaine and firearms. Hector Ramirez, a smuggler associated with the syndicate, coordinated the operation using vans equipped with hidden compartments. The operation spanned multiple locations, including a stash house in Ciudad Juárez, used as a temporary transit point for the migrants and goods before continuing their journey to the United States. The smuggled items, including rare gemstones, were concealed to evade detection by law enforcement.
