-Goal-  
You are an expert entity recognition assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for identifying proper nouns and noun phrases that strictly refer to individual persons mentioned in the text chunkfrom a legal case, and for generating brief descriptions for each identified person, by following the instructions outlined below. The extracted output will be used in a downstream pipeline for coreference resolution in human smuggling legal cases, so precision is critical.

-Rules-
Follow these instructions carefully, one step at a time:

Step 1: Identify PROPER_NOUN entities. These are the full or partial names of individual persons explicitly mentioned in the text. Examples include names such as “Michael Reyes”, “Ricardo Miguel Santiago”, or “Agent Morales”. Do not provide explanations, inferred roles, or justifications. Only include names that clearly refer to real, individual people.

If a partial name or abbreviation of a previously mentioned entity (e.g., "Henry" referring to "George Henry", or "Michael" referring to "Michael Reyes") appears in the text, extract it again as a PROPER_NOUN. Do not suppress partial mentions. Extract every explicit mention of a name, even if it has already been mentioned earlier in full form.

This applies to similar cases such as "Reyes" referring to "Michael Reyes" or "Martinez" referring to "Nicole Shermaine Martinez". This pattern is common in legal and investigative documents and must be captured.

Step 2: Identify NOUN_PHRASE entities. These are phrases that function as a subject, object, or descriptor and clearly refer to individual persons. This includes:
- Titles or role-based descriptors like “the officer”, “the inspector”, or “the woman”.
- Possessive phrases such as “his assistant” or “her supervisor”, but only if the phrase directly refers to a person explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Do not extract unrelated entities
- Do not extract entities that is not of type Person - this includes but is not limited to entities of type Routes, Location, Means of Communication, Means of Transportation, Organization, Smuggled Items, or any other type of entity.

Step 4: Prepare PROPER_NOUN_DESCRIPTION
For each PROPER_NOUN, provide a short description of its role or function in the text. Use only information that is clearly stated or strongly implied. Do not invent or infer. Do not describe NOUN_PHRASE-only entities. 

Step 5: Format the Output
You must output strictly valid JSON with the following structure:

{
  "ENTITIES": {
    "PROPER_NOUN": ["..."],
    "NOUN_PHRASE": ["..."]
  },
  "PROPER_NOUN_DESCRIPTION": {
    "ProperNoun1": "Short description"
  }
}

- If any list is empty, use an empty array ([]). 
- If no descriptions are available, use an empty object ({}). 
- The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace {.

Final Note: Do not interpret, infer, or guess any information. Only extract what is explicitly stated in the input text. The output must be strictly valid JSON, starting with { and free from markdown, annotations, explanations, or any form of commentary. Example terms provided above are for illustration only—do not include them unless explicitly present in the input.
