-Goal-
You are an expert entity recognition assistant for the entity type MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. You are responsible for identifying names and noun phrases that strictly refer to devices, applications, accounts, or services used for communication mentioned in the input text chunk from a legal case, and for generating brief descriptions for each identified entity. Your goal is to prepare high-quality means-of-communication entity data for downstream coreference resolution in human smuggling legal cases, so precision is critical.

-Rules-  
Follow these instructions carefully, one step at a time:

Step 1: Identify PROPER_NOUN entities  
These are the names of specific communication-related products, services, accounts, or applications explicitly mentioned in the text. Examples include “WhatsApp”, “Signal”, “Facebook Messenger”, “Skype account”, “WeChat account”.

Do not provide explanations, inferred roles, or justifications.  
Only include names that clearly refer to a communication device, application, service, or account used to communicate.

If a partial name or variant of a previously mentioned entity appears in the text (e.g., "WhatsApp" referring to "WhatsApp account"), extract it again as a PROPER_NOUN. Do not suppress partial mentions.

Step 2: Identify NOUN_PHRASE entities  
These are noun phrases that clearly refer to communication devices, tools, or channels, including but not limited to:
- Devices: “the phone”, “the prepaid cellphone”, “the satellite phone”, “the burner phone”, “the handset”, “the device”, “the mobile”
- Service references: “the messaging app”, “the chat application”, “the VoIP service”
- Possessive phrases such as “his phone”, “the smuggler’s device”, “her messaging app”, but only if the phrase directly refers to a communication device or service explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Do not extract unrelated entities  
Do not extract entities that are not of type Means of Communication.  
Specifically, do not extract entities of type Location, Organization, Person, Route, Means of Transportation, Smuggled Items, or any other types. 

Step 4: Prepare PROPER_NOUN_DESCRIPTION  
For each PROPER_NOUN, provide a short description of its role or function in the text. Use only information that is clearly stated or strongly implied and it should not be null. Do not invent or infer. Do not describe NOUN_PHRASE-only entities.

Step 5: Format the Output  
You must output strictly valid JSON with the following structure:

{
  "ENTITIES": {
    "PROPER_NOUN": ["..."],
    "NOUN_PHRASE": ["..."]
  },
  "PROPER_NOUN_DESCRIPTION": {
    "ProperNoun1": "Short description"
  }
}

- If any list is empty, use an empty array [].
- If no descriptions are available, use an empty object {}.
- The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace {.
- Do not include any markdown, commentary, or explanation.
- Each item in a list must be a clean string enclosed in double quotes, without any explanation or reasoning inside.

Final Note:  
Do not interpret, guess, or infer. Extract only what is explicitly stated.  
Ignore any example terms mentioned earlier — do not include them in your output unless they appear in the provided input text.
