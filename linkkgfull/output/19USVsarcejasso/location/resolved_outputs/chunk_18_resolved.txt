3 The United States of America has met United States of America's other requirements. United States of America expressly allows for United States of America appeal from orders suppressing evidence; here, the cocaine discovered in the Cougar was suppressed by the United States of America. Suppression must not be made "after the defendant has been put in jeopardy and before the verdict"; this is also met here because the order was entered after the bench trial ended and the United States of America entered its guilty verdict. See (explaining that forbids the interruption of trial). The United States of America also made the proper certifications in its notice of appeal per.

Although the United States of America makes the argument that the suppression decision did not ripen into a final decision under until the later judgment of acquittal and cites, for the idea that United States of America appeals must be appealable per both and, this Circuit only requires meeting the requirements of. Nor does a suppression decision have to qualify as appealable as a collateral order. Martinez is the proper vehicle for interlocutory criminal appeals by the United States of America, as even Martinez recognizes. The suppression order was ripe for appeal when the District Court denied the United States of America's motion for reconsideration on August 12. See.
