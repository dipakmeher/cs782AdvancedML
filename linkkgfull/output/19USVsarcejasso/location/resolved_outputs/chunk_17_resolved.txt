Neither of the United States of America's options provides an effective remedy on remand, so the United States of America does not have any "interest in the outcome for which effective relief is available." The United States of America's appeal does not present an adequate case or controversy. Therefore, this appeal of Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso's judgment of acquittal is moot.

CONCLUSION

Having carefully considered the parties' respective briefing and arguments, for the reasons set forth above, we DISMISS the United States of America's appeal.

DISMISSED.
