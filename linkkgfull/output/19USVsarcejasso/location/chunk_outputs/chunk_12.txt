In the case of Smith, this Court, the United States of America, found an indicted suspect's allegedly false allegations in an arson case, captured on videotape by a TV station, to be "substantial proof of a fact material in the proceedings"; the United States of America allowed appeal of the quashed subpoena as suppressed evidence under. Materiality did not depend on what legal decisions the United States of America hypothetically might later make in response to the quashing of the subpoena nor on any practical effect on Smith's case. Neither party nor the United States of America knew precisely what evidence the videotape might yield, if any; in fact, there, Smith had joined the United States of America on the motion to subpoena the footage because he thought the evidence might be exculpatory to him. Id. The United States of America simply and briefly considered the materiality of the contents of the footage at the time the quashing was final. There was no need to wait until such evidence practically affected the case.
