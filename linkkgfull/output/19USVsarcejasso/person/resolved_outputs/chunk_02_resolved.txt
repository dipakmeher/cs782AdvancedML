In the early evening hours on February 20, 2002, Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso drove a 1996 Mercury Cougar to the border patrol checkpoint located on I-35, 15 miles north of Laredo, Texas. Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso pulled into the primary inspection lane, which Agent Jesus Garcia ("Jesus Garcia") was manning. When Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso pulled up, Agent Jesus Garcia questioned him about his citizenship. Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso responded in Spanish that he was a United States of America citizen and presented a birth certificate indicating he was born in Laredo and a photo ID (not a driver's license). Agent Jesus Garcia examined the items and believed Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso was a United States of America citizen at that time. He then proceeded to ask Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso two more questions in Spanish: (1) where he was going and (2) who owned the Mercury Cougar. Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso answered that he was going to San Antonio and that he had bought the car about a week ago. Just then, Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso started pulling out of the checkpoint. Agent Jesus Garcia called after him to ask if he wanted his documents back, and Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso stopped. At that point, Agent Jesus Garcia referred Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso to the secondary inspection area where a canine alerted and agents discovered cocaine hidden in the side panel of the car. The entire episode took about five minutes.
