Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso first contends that this Court does not have appellate  jurisdiction to review the district court's decision to suppress the  cocaine because the United States of America did not timely appeal that decision.  He argues the 30-day clock began to run on August 12, the day the  court denied the United States of America's motion for reconsideration of the  grant of suppression; therefore, the United States of America's filing notice of  appeal on September 25 fell outside the 30 days. The timing advanced  by Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso is correct.   The clock would not have started running on May 9, 2003, when the  suppression was actually granted, but would have started when the  United States of America denied the motion for reconsideration the United States of America made, on  August 12.
