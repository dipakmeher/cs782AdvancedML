In  the early evening hours on February 20, 2002, Arce-Jasso drove a  1996 Mercury Cougar to the border patrol checkpoint located on I-35,  15 miles north of Laredo , Texas .  Arce-Jasso pulled into the primary inspection lane, which Agent  Jesus Garcia ("Garcia") was manning.    When Arce-Jasso pulled up, Agent Garcia questioned him about his  citizenship. Arce-Jasso responded in Spanish that he was a U.S.  citizen and presented a birth certificate indicating he was born in  Laredo and a photo ID (not a driver's license). Agent Garcia  examined the items and believed Arce-Jasso was a U.S. citizen at  that time. He then proceeded to ask Arce-Jasso two more questions in  Spanish: (1) where he was going and (2) who owned the Mercury  Cougar. Arce-Jasso answered that he was going to San  Antonio and that he had bought the car about a week ago. Just    then, Arce-Jasso started pulling out of the checkpoint. Agent Garcia  called after him to ask if he wanted his documents back, and  Arce-Jasso stopped. At that point, Agent Garcia referred Arce-Jasso  to the secondary inspection area where a canine alerted and agents  discovered cocaine hidden in the side panel of the car. The entire  episode took about five minutes.
