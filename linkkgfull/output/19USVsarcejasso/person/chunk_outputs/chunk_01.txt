Plaintiff-Appellant  United States of America (the "Government") seeks review  of the district court's judgment of acquittal in favor of  Defendant-Appellee Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso ("Arce-Jasso")  on possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute in violation  of and .  The Government also seeks review of the district court's denial of  the Government's motion for reconsideration of its order granting  Arce-Jasso's motion to suppress the cocaine.
