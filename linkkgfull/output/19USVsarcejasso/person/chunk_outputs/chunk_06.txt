Arce-Jasso first contends that this Court does not have appellate  jurisdiction to review the district court's decision to suppress the  cocaine because the Government did not timely appeal that decision.  He argues the 30-day clock began to run on August 12, the day the  court denied the Government's motion for reconsideration of the  grant of suppression; therefore, the Government's filing notice of  appeal on September 25 fell outside the 30 days. The timing advanced  by Arce-Jasso is correct.   The clock would not have started running on May 9, 2003, when the  suppression was actually granted, but would have started when the  court denied the motion for reconsideration the Government made, on  August 12.
