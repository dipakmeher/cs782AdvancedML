Therefore, although the Government is correct that   there are various hypothetical pathways the district court could  choose to take after granting a post-guilty verdict suppression -  immediately granting an acquittal, not changing the guilty verdict,  or granting acquittal after some time has passed - if "the  suppressed evidence is a substantial proof of a fact material in  the proceeding," then the Government should note when 30 days  will have passed after the suppression decision is final and make  the decision to file notice of appeal within 30 days, instead of  waiting until a possible acquittal is granted.
