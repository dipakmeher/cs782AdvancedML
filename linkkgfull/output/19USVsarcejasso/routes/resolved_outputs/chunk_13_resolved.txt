Therefore, although the United States of America is correct that there are various hypothetical pathways the United States of America could choose to take after granting a post-guilty verdict suppression - immediately granting an acquittal, not changing the guilty verdict, or granting acquittal after some time has passed - if "the suppressed evidence is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding," then the United States of America should note when 30 days will have passed after the suppression decision is final and make the decision to file notice of appeal within 30 days, instead of waiting until a possible acquittal is granted.
