Prior to sentencing, on January 3, 2003, Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso filed a motion for reconsideration of the District Court's original denial of the motion to suppress based on. After a hearing, the District Court granted this motion by written order entered on May 9, 2003, and suppressed the drug evidence. The United States of America filed a motion for reconsideration of this decision; and after hearing additional testimony, the District Court entered another written order on August 12, 2003, reaffirming its decision to suppress the cocaine. Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso then filed a motion seeking either a judgment of acquittal or a new trial, which the District Court granted by entering a judgment for acquittal and also a conditional order for a new trial on August 29, 2003.

On September 25, 2003, the United States of America filed a joint notice of appeal per: (1) the District Court's judgment of acquittal and (2) the District Court's order denying the United States of America's motion for reconsideration of the District Court's prior order suppressing the cocaine evidence.

DISCUSSION

Whether the United States of America has appellate jurisdiction to review the denial of the United States of America's motion to reconsider the District Court's suppression order.
