Although "the timing of the Allen-type instruction has  occasionally been a factor in appellate review of the instruction's  coercive effect," (citation omitted), this is not an occasion where the Allen charge was given prematurely, see,  e.g., ,  or where the verdict was delivered so soon after the charge as to  indicate coercion. See,  e.g., .   Nor did the federal district court jury's statements on two occasions that it was  deadlocked necessarily indicate that absent coercion, the dissenting  jurors would not have changed their minds.  To the contrary, the  fact that the federal district court jury deliberated for approximately three hours after  receiving the Allen charge and requested a clarification of the United States district court's initial  instructions indicated that the jurors heeded the Allen charge's admonition to reexamine their own views and those of other  jurors without surrendering their convictions.

Because  we do not believe the carefully worded Allen charge given to the federal district court jury unduly coerced, threatened, or pressured  dissenting jurors into surrendering    their conscientiously held views, see (per curiam),  ,  we hold use of the charge in this case was proper. Cf. .
