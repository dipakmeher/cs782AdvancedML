Id., 468 F.2d at 661, 480 F.2d at 518. Accord, United States v. Garcia. "The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has repeatedly upheld the use of the modified Allen charge." United States v. Garcia. Unless sitting en banc, we are bound by the prior decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
