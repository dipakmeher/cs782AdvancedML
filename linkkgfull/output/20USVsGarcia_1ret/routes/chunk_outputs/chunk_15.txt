In United States v. Garcia, this Court upheld a district court's refusal to conduct a post-verdict hearing on whether the federal district court jury was coerced by a properly given Allen charge, noting that "the only questions that would have been asked would have concerned the juror's internal mental processes in reaching the verdict." Here too, Maria De Jesus Garcia's defense counsel's only purpose for seeking to interview jurors was to probe the federal district court jury's "process of deliberation and find out how and why the federal district court jury reached its verdict. That is the one form of attack on a verdict that has always been forbidden in Anglo-American criminal law." The United States district court judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Maria De Jesus Garcia's motion to interview jurors.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United States district court is AFFIRMED.
