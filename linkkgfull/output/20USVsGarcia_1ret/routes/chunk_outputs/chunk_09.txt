Without determining whether any of these factors is alone dispositive, we hold that Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, considering the totality of the circumstances -- including the unusually heavy and overloaded appearance of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, the fogged windows, the history of alien smuggling on this segment of Interstate Highway 35 just above these other connecting roads to the United States-Mexican border, the unwashed and very unkempt appearance of the passengers, their efforts to avoid detection by ducking and scrambling, the late hour, and the unusually slow speed of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck -- in light of their specialized experience and training, reasonably could have an objective and particularized suspicion that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck was then transporting illegal aliens. We therefore conclude that the stop of that pickup truck did not violate the.

Once Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck was stopped, the agents were entitled to question its occupants about their citizenship and immigration status, "but any further detention or search . . . required probable cause."
