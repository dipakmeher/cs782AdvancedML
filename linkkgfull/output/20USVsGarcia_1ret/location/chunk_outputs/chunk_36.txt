9 In denying Maria De Jesus Garcia's motion for post-verdict discovery, the district court relied primarily on the fact "that any information Maria De Jesus Garcia might obtain from jurors through 'discovery' would be inadmissible under," which reads:

"Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury's deliberations or to the effect of anything upon his or any other juror's mind or emotions as influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict . . . or concerning his mental processes in connection therewith, except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror. Nor may his affidavit or evidence of any statement by him concerning a matter about which he would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes."

"A valid argument may be made that any post-trial questioning of jurors (for the purpose of impeaching the verdict) should be . . . restricted to those matters found by the trial court as both relevant and proper under" . .  On appeal, Maria De Jesus Garcia appears to concede the applicability of to her request for post-trial questioning of jurors, but claims the rule is overbroad.  We find this contention to be without merit here.
