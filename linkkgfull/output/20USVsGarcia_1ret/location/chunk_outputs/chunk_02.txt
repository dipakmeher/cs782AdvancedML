On February 18, 1983, United States Border Patrol agents Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron were sitting in their marked border patrol sedan overlooking the northbound lanes of Interstate Highway 35 just south of Moore, Texas about 115 miles from the Mexican border. At approximately 11:30 p.m., Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron spotted a pickup truck camper traveling northbound unusually slowly, its headlights angled up. The agents entered traffic to further observe the camper. They saw that its bumper was low, its tires "were squashed down," the wheel wells were covering part of the tires, and it was loaded heavily in the rear. The truck was weaving, it appearing "that the driver was having a hard time controlling the vehicle due to the weight in the back, making the front end light." When the agents pulled their car alongside the vehicle and shined a flashlight out of their window to illuminate the truck, they noticed that the windows of the camper shell were "completely fogged over." The border patrol agents testified that the night was cold, and that the fogged windows indicated to them that the camper shell contained living beings, perhaps people.
