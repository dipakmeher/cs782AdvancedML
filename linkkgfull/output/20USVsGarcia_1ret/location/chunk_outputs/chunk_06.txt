This Court has repeatedly stated that a vital element of the Brignoni-Ponce test is whether the agent had "reason to believe that the vehicle in question had come from the border." (citations omitted). "We have found this element . . . missing where the stop has occurred a substantial distance from the border." Id. See, e.g., (sixty miles from border); (on Interstate 35, eighty-five miles from border); (fifty-five miles from border).

In this case, Maria De Jesus Garcia's truck was stopped more than 100 miles from the United States-Mexican border, and neither Stanley Pruszenski nor Alfred Baron testified that they had any reason to believe the vehicle had crossed the border when they stopped it. Although Interstate 35 leads directly to the border, it passes through the city of Laredo, Texas and some seven other towns before reaching Moore. "The mere fact that a vehicle is proceeding on a public highway leading from the border but already past towns in this country is not sufficient cause to believe the vehicle came from the border."
