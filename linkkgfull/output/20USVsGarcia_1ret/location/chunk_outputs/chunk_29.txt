That some of the passengers "were sitting low" was held insufficient to justify the stop in . Such a static condition is one common to vehicle passengers. The same ruling was made in Orona-Sanchez, 648 F.2d at 1041-42, respecting the circumstance that, between the time the vehicle initially drove by the then stationary agents and the time the agents later caught up with and passed it, two of the passengers "had 'sort of slouched down'" so only the tops of their heads were visible to the passing agents. However, it was after dark and that character of change over several minutes to a more recumbent position by nighttime passengers is not unusual. Moreover, in Orona-Sanchez we gave "substantial weight to the fact that these agents were new to the area . . . ." Id. at 1042. In , we held the fact that "passengers in the back seat appeared to slouch down" as the vehicle passed the agents, while "certainly a suspicious reaction," was nevertheless not "on its own sufficient" to justify the stop. In Pacheco we made the same holding respecting similar testimony that the passengers "'hunkered down' in the seat." While the passenger conduct in Lamas and Pacheco is more suspicious than that in Pena-Cantu and Orona-Sanchez, it is clearly less suspicious than the more extensive, active, abrupt, and obviously evasive conduct described by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron here. Ducking and scrambling around is certainly less typical of innocent passengers than slouching or hunkering down. Cf. e.g., (distinguishing Orona-Sanchez and Pacheco). Because "each case must turn on the totality of the particular circumstances" in that case, , while we consider the clearly evasive actions of the passengers in Maria De Jesus Garcia's camper as a significant factor in justifying the stop, we need not determine whether it alone would suffice, other factors also being present here.
