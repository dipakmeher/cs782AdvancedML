Pruszenski was driving the agents' patrol car. While traveling alongside the truck, Baron leaned out of the window of the patrol car and observed three females in the front seat of the truck cab and five or six men in the back seat. When Baron shined his flashlight into the cab, according to the agents, the male passengers attempted to conceal themselves by ducking and scrambling down below the window. The agents testified that the men's clothes and hair appeared unwashed, dirty and "very unruly and unkempt," a characteristic considered common to individuals who have recently spent time in the brush.

Their suspicion aroused, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron stopped the camper for an immigration inspection. Upon questioning, the driver and several passengers admitted to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron that they were Mexican citizens without immigration documents. After receiving this information, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron then opened the rear window to the camper and found fourteen additional males lying down on the floor, all of whom admitted they were illegal aliens. Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron arrested Maria De Jesus Garcia, the owner of the camper, and Lourdes Rangel-Campos, the driver, and took the remaining passengers into custody.
