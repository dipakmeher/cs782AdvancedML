8  The federal district court jury began its deliberations Friday at approximately 9:00 a.m. About  one hour later, the federal district court jury sent a note to the United States district court judge requesting  information from outside the record.  The request was declined.  At  about 11:30 a.m., the federal district court jury sent a note to the United States district court judge stating: "After  deliberating for approximately 2 (two) hours we have not reached a  unanimous decision.  The jurors that are dissenting have indicated  that their decision is irreversible." The United States district court judge denied a  defense motion for mistrial and replied to the federal district court jury in a written  note: "The United States district court knows that the taking of the evidence required  two days and believes that you should continue your deliberation.  You are instructed to continue . . . deliberation."

Following a lunch break and another approximately ninety minutes of deliberation, the federal district court jury at about 2:00 p.m. again informed the United States district court judge, in a note substantially identical to its prior one, that it was deadlocked. The United States district court judge then, over objections of Maria De Jesus Garcia's counsel and a motion for mistrial, read the modified Allen charge to the federal district court jury. At about 4:45 p.m., the federal district court jury asked the United States district court judge for more clarification of the terms "reasonable doubt" and "common sense." The United States district court judge then repeated a portion of his original instructions to the federal district court jury. About forty-five minutes later, the federal district court jury returned its guilty verdict.
