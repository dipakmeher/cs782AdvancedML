We have little difficulty in accepting as a fact that the United States Border Patrol agent, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, honestly believed Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle to be carrying illegal aliens. Indeed the conviction of the appellant, Maria De Jesus Garcia, on four counts of violating is evidence of the absolute correctness of his belief. If the reasonableness of a stop depended on the United States Border Patrol agent's subjective beliefs our inquiry would end here. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, however, requires us to test this stop in a different manner.

Thus, I am unable to derive any support for the stop from the majority's description of the expertise of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, the number of arrests in which they have participated, or their ability to speak Spanish. These facts do not enhance the other facts relied upon by the majority, nor do they persuade me of the United States Border Patrol agent's superior ability to distinguish illegal aliens from lawful residents -- at least without evidence showing the number of erroneous stops made by these same agents.
