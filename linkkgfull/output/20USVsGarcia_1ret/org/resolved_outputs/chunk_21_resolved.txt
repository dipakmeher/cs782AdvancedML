The majority notes that a relevant consideration in its analysis was the apparent heavy load carried by Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle. Although we have been loath to give any weight to the "heavy load" factor in the past, see (stop held illegal, under facts quite similar to the present); , the majority offers the distinction that "here, by contrast, the testimony reflects a degree of loading that is more than merely heavy, but is indeed over loading." (Maj. op. at 1225 n. 2)

As an initial matter, the distinction between "heavy-loading" and "overloading" is dubious and more semantic than real. More importantly, however, the rejection of "heavy" or "over" -loading as a factor rests on considerations of substance, not of degree. The factor is irrelevant as a consideration to support reasonable suspicion because a "heavy load" is just as consistent with innocent conduct, e.g., a heavy load of produce or livestock, as it is with culpable conduct, e.g., smuggling illegal aliens, especially when we cannot infer that Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle in question had come from the United States-Mexico Border.
