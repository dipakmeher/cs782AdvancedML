"It is well settled that probable cause to search Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle exists when trustworthy facts and circumstances within the officer's personal knowledge would cause a reasonably prudent man to believe that Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle contains contraband. We must also be mindful that 'probable cause is the sum total of layers of information and the synthesis of what the police have heard, what they know, and what they observed as trained officers. We weigh not individual layers but the \"laminated\" total.' (United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit) (en banc), (citations omitted).

Once several passengers of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle admitted to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron that they were undocumented aliens, that fact, coupled with those observations suggesting that there were other individuals within the pickup truck camper, provided probable cause to search the pickup truck camper for other illegal aliens. Thus, no violation resulted from either the stop or search of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, and her argument to that effect must fail.
