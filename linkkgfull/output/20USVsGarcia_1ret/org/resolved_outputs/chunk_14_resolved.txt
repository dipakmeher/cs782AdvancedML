Maria De Jesus Garcia's final contention is that the United States District Court erred in refusing to allow her to conduct post-verdict "discovery" through juror depositions and interrogatories in order to determine whether the jurors were coerced by the Allen Charge. 

"Historically, interrogations of jurors have not been favored by United States Federal Courts except where there is some showing of illegal or prejudicial intrusion into the jury process." , (emphasis in original). Accord, . The only intrusion alleged here was the giving of the Allen Charge to the United States District Court Jury, which we have held was not error. That is not the type of "illegal or prejudicial intrusion into the jury process" that might justify post-verdict interviews of jurors.
