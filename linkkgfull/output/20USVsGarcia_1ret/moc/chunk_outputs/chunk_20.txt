To its credit, the panel majority has tried to apply the precedents of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a principled way to the present facts. I am afraid, however, that this attempt has only succeeded in differentiating otherwise irreconcilable precedent of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit through an unsteady calculus of what factors may permissibly be considered when determining whether United States Border Patrol agents have an objectively "reasonable suspicion" to make a stop. With great respect for the views of my brethren in the majority, I must dissent.
