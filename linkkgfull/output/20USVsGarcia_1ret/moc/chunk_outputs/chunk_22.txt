In the absence of an inference that the vehicle to be stopped came from the United States-Mexico Border, the remaining factors known to the agents must be carefully examined to determine whether "other articulable facts 'reasonably warrant suspicion'". In the present case, the remaining factors relied upon by the majority included: other illegal aliens had been seized near the location where the agents encountered Maria De Jesus Garcia; the interstate highway on which Maria De Jesus Garcia was traveling was "a common smuggling route"; the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle were unwashed and unkempt; the type of pickup truck driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, a Maria De Jesus Garcia’s Vehicle with a pickup truck camper attached to the back of it, is often used to transport illegal aliens; the windows of the pickup truck camper attachment appeared to be fogged, suggesting that the pickup truck camper carried living cargo; the lateness of the hour at the time of the stop; the scrambling of the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia’s Vehicle when Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron shined their flashlight at them; the seemingly heavy load in Maria De Jesus Garcia’s Vehicle; the speed of Maria De Jesus Garcia’s Vehicle; and the specialized training of United States Border Patrol involved in the stop. Because I believe that the consideration of several of these factors departs from the precedents of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, despite the majority's distinguishment of them as not controlling, and that the remaining factors cannot, standing alone, support the stop of Maria De Jesus Garcia’s Vehicle, I cannot join the opinion of the panel majority, excellently reasoned as it is.
