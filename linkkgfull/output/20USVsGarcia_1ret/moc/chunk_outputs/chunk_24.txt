We have also refused to accord weight to the observations of United States Border Patrol agents that a vehicle's occupants "hunkered down" when the agents passed or were sitting low so as to avoid detection, see ; , or that the occupants of a vehicle were startled by the beam of a United States Border Patrol agent's flashlight. The majority reasons that these decisions are inapposite since the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle "did much more than merely avoid eye contact with the agent's flashlight." (Maj. op. at 1224 n. 1). The United States Border Patrol agents testified that the occupants were "moving and slouching low as to get out of the light trying to hide." Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, or more specifically Alfred Baron, testified that, after he shined his flashlight into Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, "they were scrambling around trying to get lower than the windows were so that . . . I couldn't see them with a flashlight. They were scrambling around in the interior of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle." The majority considered this testimony relevant since "ducking and scrambling around is certainly less typical of innocent passengers than slouching or hunkering down." (Maj. op. at 1225).
