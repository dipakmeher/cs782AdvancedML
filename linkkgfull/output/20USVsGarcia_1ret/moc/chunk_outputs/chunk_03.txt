Pruszenski was driving the marked United States Border Patrol sedan. While traveling alongside Maria De Jesus Garcia’s Vehicle, Baron leaned out of the window of the marked United States Border Patrol sedan and observed three females in the front seat of the truck cab and five or six men in the back seat of the truck. When Baron shined his flashlight into the truck cab, according to the United States Border Patrol, the male passengers attempted to conceal themselves by ducking and scrambling down below the window. The United States Border Patrol testified that the men's clothes and hair appeared unwashed, dirty and "very unruly and unkempt," a characteristic considered common to individuals who have recently spent time in the brush.
