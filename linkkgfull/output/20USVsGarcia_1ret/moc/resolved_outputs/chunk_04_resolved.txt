Their suspicion aroused, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron stopped the pickup truck camper and Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle for an immigration inspection. Upon questioning, the driver and several passengers admitted to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron that they were Mexican citizens without immigration documents. After receiving this information, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron then opened the rear window to the pickup truck camper and found fourteen additional males lying down on the floor of the pickup truck camper, all of whom admitted they were illegal aliens. Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron arrested Maria De Jesus Garcia, the owner of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, and Lourdes Rangel-Campos, the driver, and took the remaining passengers into custody.

Before trial, Maria De Jesus Garcia's defense counsel moved to suppress evidence obtained by the United States Government as a result of the stop and search of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle. Maria De Jesus Garcia's defense counsel also moved to extend the deadline for filing the suppression motion, which had already passed. Although the United States District Court denied the extension motion, it allowed the defendant at trial to present evidence pertinent to the suppression motion, and made oral findings of fact regarding the constitutionality of the stop and search, concluding that they were proper. The United States Government on appeal waives any objection to the timeliness of Maria De Jesus Garcia's suppression motion, and we consider it on its merits.
