At the outset, we note that "it is well settled in this circuit that the Allen charge is permissible, within the limitations of our prior decisions." (footnote omitted). Maria De Jesus Garcia does not attack the language of the Allen charge used below, which "was well within these limitations."

In United States v. Garcia, aff'd en banc, this Court rejected a general attack on the Allen charge as being inherently coercive in any form. Id., 468 F.2d at 661, 480 F.2d at 518. Accord, United States v. Garcia. "This Court has repeatedly upheld the use of the modified Allen charge." United States v. Garcia. Unless sitting en banc, we are bound by the prior decisions of this Court.

Maria De Jesus Garcia also argues that the Allen charge was particularly coercive as used in this case because the charge was given to the jury on a Friday afternoon, after the jury had twice indicated that it was deadlocked and that the dissenting jurors' decisions were irreversible. Maria De Jesus Garcia contends the charge coerced the dissenting jurors, who Maria De Jesus Garcia presumes desired an acquittal, into voting to convict. The decision on whether the Allen charge should be given, and when it should be given, "is within the sound discretion of the trial judge." We find no abuse of discretion here.
