At  the outset, we note that   "it is well settled in this circuit that the Allen charge is permissible, within the limitations of our prior  decisions." (footnote omitted).  Garcia does not attack the language of the Allen charge used below, which "was well within these limitation."

.   In , aff'd  en banc , ,  this Court rejected a general attack on the Allen charge as being inherently coercive in any form. Id. ,  468 F.2d at 661, 480 F.2d at 518. Accord, .   "This Court has repeatedly upheld the use of the modified Allen charge." .  Unless sitting en  banc ,  we are bound by the prior decisions of this Court. .

Garcia also argues that the Allen charge was particularly coercive as used in this case because the  charge was given to the jury on a Friday afternoon, after the jury  had twice indicated that it was deadlocked and that the dissenting  jurors' decisions were irreversible. Garcia contends the charge coerced the dissenting jurors, who Garcia  presumes desired an acquittal, into voting to convict.  The decision  on whether the Allen charge should be given, and when it should be given, "is within  the sound discretion of the trial judge." .   We find no abuse of discretion here.
