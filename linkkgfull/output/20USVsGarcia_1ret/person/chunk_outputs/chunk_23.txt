I  am unwilling to believe that, based upon a fleeting moment of  observation, border patrol agents are able to accurately assess that  the occupants of a vehicle are "trying to hide" rather  than reacting to a bright light.  Furthermore, I cannot distinguish  the "ducking and scrambling" in this case from the  "slouching and hunkering down" that we previously refused  to consider as a factor supporting the reasonableness of a stop. See ; Pena-Cantu,  supra ,  659 F.2d at 1229-30. Where, as here, a great deal of physical  movement occurs in the interior of a vehicle at night immediately  after a bright flashlight is directed at the occupants, I cannot in  a "chary" review of the facts (as required where the stop  is made miles and miles from the border, see decisions cited, supra )  conclude that the truck occupants' reaction to the beam of the  agent's flashlight should be weighed as a significant factor  supporting a reasonable suspicion that the truck was transporting  aliens.
