In ,  this Court upheld a district court's refusal to conduct a  post-verdict hearing on whether the jury was coerced by a properly  given Allen charge, noting that "the only questions that would have been  asked would have concerned the juror's internal mental processes in  reaching the verdict." .  Here too, defense counsel's only purpose for seeking to interview  jurors was to probe the jury's "process of deliberation and  find out how and why the jury reached its verdict.  That is the one  form of attack on a verdict that has always been forbidden in  Anglo-American criminal law." . The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Garcia's  motion to interview jurors.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is  AFFIRMED.
