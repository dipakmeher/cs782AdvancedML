A  pickup truck was stopped at about 11:30 p.m. by border patrol agents  on an Interstate Highway in Texas some 115 miles north of the  Mexican border. So far as the agents were able to glimpse, there  were three women in the front seat of the truck cab and five or six  men in the back seat.  To the pickup truck was affixed a heavily  loaded camper attachment.  The essential issue concerns the  lawfulness or not of the stop of this vehicle.  Believing that,  stripped to its essence, the stop was based upon no more than the  border patrolmen's speculation that poor and dirty Hispanic  appearing persons might possibly be Mexican aliens who had crossed  the border illegally some 115 miles south of the stop, and that  "reasonable suspicion" of illegal alien entry cannot be  based upon the mere circumstance    that a crowded pickup truck of dirty appearing Hispanic-descended  workmen is traveling on an Interstate highway at 11:30 in the  evening, I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion,  which, I concede, is excellent and thorough and has fairly  presented    the factual picture.
