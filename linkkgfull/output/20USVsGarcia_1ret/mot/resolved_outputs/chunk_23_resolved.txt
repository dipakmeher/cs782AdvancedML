A factor affecting the lawfulness of a stop should not rest on the subtleties of the difference, if indeed there is one, between "ducking and scrambling" and "slouching and hunkering down." The essence of the majority's distinction unfortunately rests not on the physical actions of the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia’s pickup truck, which can be observed by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, but on the motives for which the occupants took those physical actions (their desire to hide), something which could not be observed by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron. The "undisputed" testimony of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron was that this "ducking and scrambling" took place immediately after they had shined their flashlight into the dark cabin of Maria De Jesus Garcia’s pickup truck. The physical reactions of the occupants may have been a response to the beam of the flashlight, a circumstance which the majority concedes would render their conduct irrelevant. See (finding that "reasonable suspicion should not turn on the ophthalmological reactions of Maria De Jesus Garcia"). Of course, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron here also testified that an additional motive of the occupants' actions (beyond reacting to the light) was "to conceal themselves" so as to avoid detection.
