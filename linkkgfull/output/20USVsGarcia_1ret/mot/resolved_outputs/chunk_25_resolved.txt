Another factor relied upon by the majority is also, in my view, unworthy of meaningful weight. The United States district court refers to the lateness of the hour as a relevant consideration adding to reasonable suspicion. We have held, however, that a "decision to travel such roads at less busy hours should not be the difference -- constitutionally speaking -- determinative of the right of the officers to stop vehicles."

Admittedly, however, other factors relied upon by the majority perhaps do merit consideration, e.g., the previous experience of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron with illegal alien traffic on Interstate Highway 35, the type of vehicle driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, and the unkempt appearances of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck's occupants. Carefully weighing these remaining factors, I conclude that Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron had insufficient articulable facts to support a reasonable suspicion that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia was transporting illegal aliens. Foremost among my concerns are (1) the distance between the United States-Mexican border and the point at which the stop occurred, and (2) my hesitation to credit the ability of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron to distinguish an illegal alien from a lawful resident, based on physical appearances, after a few quick glimpses while traveling at considerable speeds on Interstate Highway 35.
