To its credit, the panel majority has tried to apply the precedents of this Court in a principled way to the present facts. I am afraid, however, that this attempt has only succeeded in differentiating otherwise irreconcilable precedent of this Court through an unsteady calculus of what factors may permissibly be considered when determining whether border patrol agents have an objectively "reasonable suspicion" to make a stop. With great respect for the views of my brethren in the majority, I must dissent.

II.

The majority correctly notes that this stop by roving border patrol agents, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, requires the application of the multi-factorial test of. Accordingly, we must assess the lawfulness of the stop in light of the totality of the circumstances known to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron at the time of the stop. A vital element of this test is whether the agent who made the stop had "reason to believe that the vehicle in question had come from the border." The defendant, Maria De Jesus Garcia, was stopped on an interstate highway in Texas 115 miles north of the United States-Mexican border. As the majority candidly admits, nothing in this case suggests that Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron had any reason to believe that Maria De Jesus Garcia’s pickup truck had come from the United States-Mexican border.
