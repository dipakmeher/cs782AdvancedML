8  The federal district court jury began its deliberations Friday at approximately 9:00 a.m. About  one hour later, the federal district court jury sent a note to the United States district court judge requesting  information from outside the record.  The request was declined.  At  about 11:30 a.m., the federal district court jury sent a note to the United States district court judge stating: "After  deliberating for approximately 2 (two) hours we have not reached a  unanimous decision.  The jurors that are dissenting have indicated  that their decision is irreversible." The United States district court judge denied a  defense motion for mistrial and replied to the federal district court jury in a written  note: "The United States district court knows that the taking of the evidence required  two days and believes that you should continue your deliberation.  You are instructed to continue . . . deliberation."
