This Court has repeatedly stated that a vital element of the Brignoni-Ponce test is whether the agent had "reason to believe that the vehicle in question had come from the United States-Mexican border." (citations omitted). "We have found this element . . . missing where the stop has occurred a substantial distance from the United States-Mexican border." Id. See, e.g., (sixty miles from United States-Mexican border); (on Interstate Highway 35, eighty-five miles from United States-Mexican border); (fifty-five miles from United States-Mexican border).

In this case, Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck was stopped more than 100 miles from the United States-Mexican border, and neither Stanley Pruszenski nor Alfred Baron testified that they had any reason to believe the vehicle had crossed the United States-Mexican border when they stopped it. Although Interstate Highway 35 leads directly to the United States-Mexican border, it passes through the city of Laredo, Texas and some seven other towns before reaching Moore, Texas. "The mere fact that a vehicle is proceeding on a public highway leading from the United States-Mexican border but already past towns in this country is not sufficient cause to believe the vehicle came from the United States-Mexican border."
