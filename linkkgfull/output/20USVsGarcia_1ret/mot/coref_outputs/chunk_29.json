  "AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS": {
    "Maria De Jesus Garcia\u2019s pickup truck": "Vehicle used in the transportation of undocumented aliens, stopped by border patrol for immigration inspection, and subject to a suppression motion regarding evidence obtained from the stop and search. Stopped more than 100 miles from the United States-Mexican border. Factors relevant to Brignoni-Ponce standard are present. Occupants were unwashed and unkempt, and made attempts to evade detection. The vehicle was stopped based on an objective and particularized suspicion that it was transporting illegal aliens. Probable cause to search existed due to admissions of undocumented status by passengers and observations suggesting additional individuals in the pickup truck camper. Carried three women in the front seat and five or six men in the back seat. Driven on a common smuggling route. Noted for carrying an apparent heavy load. Occupants were observed scrambling around trying to hide when a flashlight was shone into the vehicle. Occupants' actions included ducking and scrambling, possibly in response to a flashlight beam. Passengers allegedly made evasive actions when a light was shone into the cab.",
