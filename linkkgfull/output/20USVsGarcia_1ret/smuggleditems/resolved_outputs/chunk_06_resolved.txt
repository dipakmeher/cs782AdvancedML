This Court has repeatedly stated that a vital element of the Brignoni-Ponce Standard test is whether the agent had "reason to believe that Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle had come from the United States-Mexico Border." (citations omitted). "We have found this element . . . missing where the stop has occurred a substantial distance from the United States-Mexico Border." Id. See, e.g., (sixty miles from United States-Mexico Border); (on Interstate Highway 35, eighty-five miles from United States-Mexico Border); (fifty-five miles from United States-Mexico Border).

In this case, Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle was stopped more than 100 miles from the United States-Mexico Border, and neither Stanley Pruszenski nor Alfred Baron testified that they had any reason to believe Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle had crossed the United States-Mexico Border when they stopped it. Although Interstate Highway 35 leads directly to the United States-Mexico Border, it passes through the city of Laredo, Texas and some seven other towns before reaching Moore, Texas. "The mere fact that Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle is proceeding on a public highway leading from the United States-Mexico Border but already past towns in this country is not sufficient cause to believe Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle came from the United States-Mexico Border."
