Without determining whether any of these factors is alone dispositive, we hold that Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, considering the totality of the circumstances -- including the unusually heavy and overloaded appearance of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, the fogged windows, the history of illegal alien smugglers on Interstate Highway 35 just above these other connecting roads to the United States-Mexico Border, the unwashed and very unkempt appearance of the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, their efforts to avoid detection by ducking and scrambling, the late hour, and the unusually slow speed of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle -- in light of their specialized experience and training, reasonably could have an objective and particularized suspicion that Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle was then transporting undocumented aliens. We therefore conclude that the stop of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle did not violate the.

Once Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle was stopped, the illegal alien smugglers were entitled to question its occupants about their citizenship and immigration status, "but any further detention or search . . . required probable cause."
