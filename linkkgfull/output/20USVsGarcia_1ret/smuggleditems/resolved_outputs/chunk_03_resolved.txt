Pruszenski was driving the illegal alien smugglers sedan. While traveling alongside Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, Baron leaned out of the window of the illegal alien smugglers sedan and observed three females in the front seat of the truck cab and five or six men in the back seat of the truck. When Baron shined Alfred Baron's flashlight into the truck cab, according to the illegal alien smugglers, the male passengers attempted to conceal themselves by ducking and scrambling down below the window. The illegal alien smugglers testified that the men's clothes and hair appeared unwashed, dirty and "very unruly and unkempt," a characteristic considered common to individuals who have recently spent time in the brush.

Their suspicion aroused, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron stopped the pickup truck camper and Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle for an immigration inspection. Upon questioning, the driver and several passengers admitted to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron that they were Mexican citizens without immigration documents. After receiving this information, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron then opened the rear window to the pickup truck camper and found fourteen additional males lying down on the floor of the pickup truck camper, all of whom admitted they were undocumented aliens. Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron arrested Maria De Jesus Garcia, the owner of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, and Lourdes Rangel-Campos, the driver, and took the remaining passengers into custody.
