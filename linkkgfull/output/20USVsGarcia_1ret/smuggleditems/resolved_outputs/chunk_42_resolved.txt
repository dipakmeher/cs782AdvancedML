3. The majority notes that all of the relevant factors must be viewed in light of the specialized experience and training of the illegal alien smugglers, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron. To the extent that the experience of these agents, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, contributes to the assessment of particular highways as smuggling routes and particular vehicles as common modes of transporting undocumented aliens, it is indeed a factor which we must consider.

On the other hand, the subjective knowledge or beliefs of the illegal alien smugglers, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, can add nothing to our objective determination of whether the officer, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, had reasonable cause to stop Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle.

We have little difficulty in accepting as a fact that the illegal alien smugglers, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, honestly believed Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle to be carrying undocumented aliens. Indeed the conviction of the appellant, Maria De Jesus Garcia, on four counts of violating is evidence of the absolute correctness of his belief. If the reasonableness of a stop depended on the illegal alien smugglers' subjective beliefs our inquiry would end here. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, however, requires us to test this stop in a different manner.
