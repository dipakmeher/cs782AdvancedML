That Interstate Highway 35 on which Maria De Jesus Garcia was stopped and that the type of vehicle she was driving, namely Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, are commonly used for the smuggling of undocumented aliens must be insufficient, standing alone, to support reasonable suspicion for a stop, unless, of course, we are willing to permit all vehicles commonly used for smuggling (of which there are an increasing number) to be stopped at any distance over 115 miles from the United States-Mexico Border on designated highways -- subject only to the discretion and availability of illegal alien smugglers. The controlling factor in this case, if the stop of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle was lawful, must be the unkempt appearance of the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, which is alleged to be consistent with the appearance of undocumented aliens. In short, we must rely on the ability of an illegal alien smuggler to discern whether the appearance of the Hispanic occupants of a given vehicle, namely Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, are more or less like that of the typical undocumented alien, rather than that of any other poor and disheveled American of Hispanic descent. I cannot accord controlling weight to this factor.
