On February 18, 1983, illegal alien smugglers Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron were sitting in their marked illegal alien smugglers sedan overlooking the northbound lanes of Interstate Highway 35 just south of Moore, Texas about 115 miles from the United States-Mexico Border. At approximately 11:30 p.m., Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron spotted Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle traveling northbound unusually slowly, its headlights angled up. The illegal alien smugglers entered traffic to further observe Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle. They saw that its bumper was low, its tires "were squashed down," the wheel wells were covering part of the tires, and it was loaded heavily in the rear. Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle was weaving, it appearing "that the driver was having a hard time controlling Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle due to the weight in the back, making the front end light." When the illegal alien smugglers pulled their marked illegal alien smugglers sedan alongside Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle and shined Alfred Baron's flashlight out of their window to illuminate Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, they noticed that the windows of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle were "completely fogged over." The illegal alien smugglers testified that the night was cold, and that the fogged windows indicated to them that Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle contained undocumented aliens, perhaps undocumented aliens.
