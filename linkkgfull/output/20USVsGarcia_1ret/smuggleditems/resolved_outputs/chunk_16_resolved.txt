A Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle was stopped at about 11:30 p.m. by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron on Interstate Highway 35 in Texas some 115 miles north of the United States-Mexico Border. So far as Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron were able to glimpse, there were three females, who are undocumented aliens, in the front seat of the truck cab and five or six men, who are undocumented aliens, in the back seat of the truck. To Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle was affixed a heavily loaded pickup truck camper. The essential issue concerns the lawfulness or not of the stop of this vehicle. Believing that, stripped to its essence, the stop was based upon no more than Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron's speculation that poor and dirty Hispanic appearing persons, who are undocumented aliens, might possibly be Mexican aliens, who are undocumented aliens, who had crossed the United States-Mexico Border illegally some 115 miles south of the stop, and that "reasonable suspicion" of illegal alien entry cannot be based upon the mere circumstance that a crowded Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle of dirty appearing Hispanic-descended workmen, who are undocumented aliens, is traveling on an interstate highway at 11:30 in the evening, I, TATE, must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion, which, I concede, is excellent and thorough and has fairly presented the factual picture.
