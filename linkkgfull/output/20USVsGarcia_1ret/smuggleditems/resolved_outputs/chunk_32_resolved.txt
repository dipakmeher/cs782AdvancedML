That some of the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle "were sitting low" was held insufficient to justify the stop of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle in United States. Such a static condition is one common to passengers. The same ruling was made in Orona-Sanchez, 648 F.2d at 1041-42, respecting the circumstance that, between the time Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle initially drove by the then stationary agents and the time the agents later caught up with and passed it, two of the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle "had 'sort of slouched down'" so only the tops of their heads were visible to the passing agents. However, it was after dark and that character of change over several minutes to a more recumbent position by nighttime passengers is not unusual. Moreover, in Orona-Sanchez we gave "substantial weight to the fact that these agents were new to the area . . . ." Id. at 1042. In the United States District Court, we held the fact that "passengers in the back seat of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle appeared to slouch down" as Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle passed the agents, while "certainly a suspicious reaction," was nevertheless not "on its own sufficient" to justify the stop of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle. In Pacheco we made the same holding respecting similar testimony that the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle "'hunkered down'" in the back seat of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle. While the passenger conduct in Lamas and Pacheco is more suspicious than that in Pena-Cantu and Orona-Sanchez, it is clearly less suspicious than the more extensive, active, abrupt, and obviously evasive conduct described by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron here. Ducking and scrambling around is certainly less typical of innocent passengers than slouching or hunkering down. Cf. e.g., (distinguishing Orona-Sanchez and Pacheco). Because "each case must turn on the totality of the particular circumstances" in that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, while we consider the clearly evasive actions of the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle and the pickup truck camper as a significant factor in justifying the stop of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, we need not determine whether it alone would suffice, other factors also being present here.
