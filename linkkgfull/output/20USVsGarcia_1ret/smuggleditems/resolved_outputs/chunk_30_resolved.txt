Maria De Jesus Garcia asserts that the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle allegedly evasive actions were merely attempts to avoid eye contact with the beam from Alfred Baron's flashlight shined by Alfred Baron into Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle. If Maria De Jesus Garcia's characterization of the facts is correct, then we must disregard these actions, because "the avoidance of eye contact can have no weight whatsoever" in the suspicion calculus. Moreover, "it is not unusual for one . . . to be startled by lights being flashed suddenly into the interior of his vehicle." Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron testified, however, that the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle did much more than merely avoid eye contact with Alfred Baron's flashlight. Stanley Pruszenski testified that when the light was shone into the cab, "behind the front seat of Maria De Jesus Garcia's Vehicle, we could observe five or six people moving and slouching low as to get out of the light trying to hide." Alfred Baron, who was closer to the vehicle carrying the undocumented aliens, testified:

"As soon as I turned on Alfred Baron's flashlight, there was a male . . . looking out the window in this crew cab. As soon as I turned on Alfred Baron's flashlight, he ducked, and the rest of the men were making the biggest effort they could to conceal themselves where they could not be seen.
