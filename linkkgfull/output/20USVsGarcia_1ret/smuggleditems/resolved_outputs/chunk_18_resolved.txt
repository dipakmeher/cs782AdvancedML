The perceived social problem in controlling the hordes of undocumented aliens from Mexico, does not, in my opinion, justify stopping people of Hispanic-descent appearance far from the United States-Mexico Border, simply because the hour is late and they appear to be poor and dirty working undocumented aliens, any more than it would justify the similar arbitrary stop of any native-born or naturalized American simply because he has the same characteristics of appearance. A few of the decisions of this the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that have upheld stops by immigration agents have come perilously close to ignoring this fundamental constitutional concept, in relying upon one slight circumstance or another, in conjunction with the totality of its context, as entitling these illegal alien smugglers to a stop-justifying "reasonable" suspicion. In the present instance, based upon an addition of some slight circumstances relied upon in these other scattered decisions, not of themselves sufficient (out of their context) to justify reasonable suspicion, the majority nevertheless finds the stop justified, although in the present context these circumstances do not add up to reasons justifying reasonable suspicion of illegal entry.
