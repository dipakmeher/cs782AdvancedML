Both parties agree that because the investigatory stop in this case was made by roving United States Border Patrol agents, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, the legality of the stop must be determined according to the principles articulated in. In that decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that "except at the United States-Mexico Border and its functional equivalents, officers on roving patrol may stop vehicles only if they are aware of specific articulable facts, together with reasonable inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicles contain aliens who may be illegally in the United States.". The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated that the following factors may be considered in determining whether a stop is justified: characteristics of the area in which the vehicle is encountered, including proximity to the United States-Mexico Border, usual traffic patterns, and history of illegal alien traffic; type and appearance of the vehicle, including whether it appears heavily loaded; behavior of the driver; and number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers. These factors are not exclusive. Rather, "the totality of the circumstances -- the whole picture -- must be taken into account.". Accord,. "Based upon that whole picture the detaining officers, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting . . . the particular vehicle they stopped was engaged in criminal activity.". "In all situations, the officer is entitled to assess the facts in light of his experience in detecting illegal entry and smuggling."
