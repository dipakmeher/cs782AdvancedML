8  The United States District Court Jury began its deliberations Friday at approximately 9:00 a.m. About  one hour later, the United States District Court Jury sent the United States District Court Jury note to the United States District Court Judge requesting  information from outside the record.  The request was declined.  At  about 11:30 a.m., the United States District Court Jury sent the United States District Court Jury note to the United States District Court Judge stating: "After  deliberating for approximately 2 (two) hours we have not reached a  unanimous decision.  The jurors that are dissenting have indicated  that their decision is irreversible." The United States District Court Judge denied a  defense motion for mistrial and replied to the United States District Court Jury in a written  note: "The United States District Court knows that the taking of the evidence required  two days and believes that you should continue your deliberation.  You are instructed to continue . . . deliberation."
