As one of the stated reasons for the stop, David Fitzgerald noticed that Carlos Martinez-Romero was traveling at a very low rate of speed when David Fitzgerald first passed him. David Fitzgerald testified that Carlos Martinez-Romero traveled approximately fifty miles per hour on IH-35 where the stated speed limit was seventy miles per hour. Additionally, David Fitzgerald observed that Carlos Martinez-Romero appeared very tense and rigid. When David Fitzgerald turned his vehicle around to follow Carlos Martinez-Romero, he testified that Carlos Martinez-Romero consistently looked in his rear-view mirror and weaved within his lane. Further, David Fitzgerald testified that as he pulled alongside Carlos Martinez-Romero's truck, Carlos Martinez-Romero moved away from the wheel and attempted to position himself between the door jamb in between the front door and the crew-cab section of the truck. While glances in one's rear-view mirror do not necessarily constitute peculiar behavior, we agree that Carlos Martinez-Romero's attempts to hide himself from David Fitzgerald's view qualify as a suspicious activity.
