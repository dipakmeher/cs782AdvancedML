David Fitzgerald cited the modification to the crew-cab's backseat as another articulated reason for conducting the stop. When David Fitzgerald first passed Carlos Martinez-Romero he observed that the back seat was missing. As discussed earlier, consistent with the agent's testimony regarding previous illegal alien and narcotics stops, often the back seat area of crew-cabs provides the stow-away location. In fact, David Fitzgerald testified that in his experience as a Border Patrol Agent, never had he encountered a modification like that on Carlos Martinez-Romero's truck which did not serve an illegal purpose.

Vehicle Registration

Prior to the stop, David Fitzgerald ran a license and vehicle registration check on Carlos Martinez-Romero's truck. David Fitzgerald discovered the vehicle was registered in Edna, Texas. David Fitzgerald testified that in his experience, several of the alien-smuggling vehicles he apprehended in the past originated from Edna, a suburb of Dallas. See (citing border patrol's experience that many smugglers travel en route to larger cities such as Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas, and thus vehicle registration in Dallas to an individual other than Carlos Martinez-Romero contributed to patrol's decision to detain vehicle).
