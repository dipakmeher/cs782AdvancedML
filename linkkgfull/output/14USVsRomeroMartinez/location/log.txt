You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

Example:
{
  "RESOLVED_ENTITIES": {
    "the city": "Laredo, Texas",
    "Laredo": "Laredo, Texas",
    "Laredo-bound": "Laredo, Texas-bound",

The stop took place in Cotulla, Texas, approximately sixty-eight miles from the Texas-Mexico border. Conversing with Carlos Martinez-Romero in both Spanish and English, David Fitzgerald requested that Carlos Martinez-Romero produce proof of citizenship. Carlos Martinez-Romero presented proper proof of Mexican citizenship as well as a valid border-crosser card. While standing by the vehicle, David Fitzgerald noticed the strong odor of carpet freshener and observed freshener sprinkled on the floorboard of the truck. Suspecting that Carlos Martinez-Romero used the deodorizer to eliminate the scent of illegal drugs, David Fitzgerald obtained Carlos Martinez-Romero's consent to examine a toolbox located in the back of the truck. Although Carlos Martinez-Romero denied possessing the key, David Fitzgerald opened the toolbox with a key attached to the ignition and found six bundles of marijuana totaling one hundred and sixty-nine pounds. David Fitzgerald arrested Carlos Martinez-Romero for illegal drug possession. A jury found Carlos Martinez-Romero guilty of possession and imposed a sentence of seven years imprisonment. In a single issue, Carlos Martinez-Romero argues no reasonable suspicion existed to authorize the stop and therefore the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of marijuana at trial.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW"

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

  "TEXT": "At approximately noon on May 24, 1998, Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald conducted an investigatory stop of Carlos Martinez-Romero as he traveled north on Interstate 35 in a crew-cab truck. The stop took place in Cotulla, Texas, approximately sixty-eight miles from the Texas-Mexico border. Conversing with Carlos Martinez-Romero in both Spanish and English, David Fitzgerald requested that Carlos Martinez-Romero produce proof of citizenship. Carlos Martinez-Romero presented proper proof of Mexican citizenship as well as a valid border-crosser card. While standing by the vehicle, David Fitzgerald noticed the strong odor of carpet freshener and observed freshener sprinkled on the floorboard of the truck. Suspecting that Carlos Martinez-Romero used the deodorizer to eliminate the scent of illegal drugs, David Fitzgerald obtained Carlos Martinez-Romero's consent to examine a toolbox located in the back of the truck. Although Carlos Martinez-Romero denied possessing the key, David Fitzgerald opened the toolbox with a key attached to the ignition and found six bundles of marijuana totaling one hundred and sixty-nine pounds. David Fitzgerald arrested Carlos Martinez-Romero for illegal drug possession. A jury found Carlos Martinez-Romero guilty of possession and imposed a sentence of seven years imprisonment. In a single issue, Carlos Martinez-Romero argues no reasonable suspicion existed to authorize the stop and therefore the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of marijuana at trial.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW"

See (holding a stop sixty miles from the border insufficient to establish that the vehicle originated from the border); (finding that stop conducted ninety miles from the border amounted to mere suspicion that vehicle came from the border).\n\nHere, neither the State nor Carlos Martinez-Romero contest that David Fitzgerald conducted the stop approximately sixty-eight miles from the border. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of Carlos Martinez-Romero.\n\nOfficer's Previous Experience\n\nAgent David Fitzgerald testified that in his four years of experience as a Border Patrol Agent, crew-cab trucks missing a backseat, similar to that which Carlos Martinez-Romero drove, invariably indicate the stowage of illegal aliens or narcotics. David Fitzgerald testified, \"I've never seen a vehicle that was modified in such a way that was not used for either transporting illegal aliens or narcotics.\""

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

David Fitzgerald testified that Carlos Martinez-Romero traveled approximately fifty miles per hour on IH-35 where the stated speed limit was seventy miles per hour. Additionally, David Fitzgerald observed that Carlos Martinez-Romero appeared very tense and rigid. When David Fitzgerald turned his vehicle around to follow Carlos Martinez-Romero, he testified that Carlos Martinez-Romero consistently looked in his rear-view mirror and weaved within his lane. Further, David Fitzgerald testified that as he pulled alongside Carlos Martinez-Romero's truck, Carlos Martinez-Romero moved away from the wheel and attempted to position himself between the door jamb in between the front door and the crew-cab section of the truck. While glances in one's rear-view mirror do not necessarily constitute peculiar behavior, we agree that Carlos Martinez-Romero's attempts to hide himself from David Fitzgerald's view qualify as a suspicious activity.\n\nPhysical Aspects of the Vehicle"

David Fitzgerald discovered the vehicle was  registered in Edna, Texas. David Fitzgerald testified that in his  experience, several of the alien-smuggling    vehicles he apprehended in the past originated from Edna, a suburb  of Dallas.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

  "TEXT": "At approximately noon on May 24, 1998, Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald conducted an investigatory stop of Carlos Martinez-Romero as he traveled north on Interstate 35 in a crew-cab truck. The stop took place in Cotulla, Texas, approximately sixty-eight miles from the Texas-Mexico border. Conversing with Carlos Martinez-Romero in both Spanish and English, David Fitzgerald requested that Carlos Martinez-Romero produce proof of citizenship. Carlos Martinez-Romero presented proper proof of Mexican citizenship as well as a valid border-crosser card. While standing by the vehicle, David Fitzgerald noticed the strong odor of carpet freshener and observed freshener sprinkled on the floorboard of the truck. Suspecting that Carlos Martinez-Romero used the deodorizer to eliminate the scent of illegal drugs, David Fitzgerald obtained Carlos Martinez-Romero's consent to examine a toolbox located in the back of the truck. Although Carlos Martinez-Romero denied possessing the key, David Fitzgerald opened the toolbox with a key attached to the ignition and found six bundles of marijuana totaling one hundred and sixty-nine pounds. David Fitzgerald arrested Carlos Martinez-Romero for illegal drug possession. A jury found Carlos Martinez-Romero guilty of possession and imposed a sentence of seven years imprisonment. In a single issue, Carlos Martinez-Romero argues no reasonable suspicion existed to authorize the stop and therefore the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of marijuana at trial.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW"

- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

Example:
{

The stop took place in Cotulla, Texas, approximately sixty-eight miles from the Texas-Mexico border. Conversing with Carlos Martinez-Romero in both Spanish and English, David Fitzgerald requested that Carlos Martinez-Romero produce proof of citizenship. Carlos Martinez-Romero presented proper proof of Mexican citizenship as well as a valid border-crosser card. While standing by the vehicle, David Fitzgerald noticed the strong odor of carpet freshener and observed freshener sprinkled on the floorboard of the truck. Suspecting that Carlos Martinez-Romero used the deodorizer to eliminate the scent of illegal drugs, David Fitzgerald obtained Carlos Martinez-Romero's consent to examine a toolbox located in the back of the truck. Although Carlos Martinez-Romero denied possessing the key, David Fitzgerald opened the toolbox with a key attached to the ignition and found six bundles of marijuana totaling one hundred and sixty-nine pounds. David Fitzgerald arrested Carlos Martinez-Romero for illegal drug possession. A jury found Carlos Martinez-Romero guilty of possession and imposed a sentence of seven years imprisonment. In a single issue, Carlos Martinez-Romero argues no reasonable suspicion existed to authorize the stop and therefore the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of marijuana at trial.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW"

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

As  discussed earlier, consistent with the agent's testimony regarding  previous illegal alien and narcotics stops, often the back seat area  of crew-cabs provides the stow-away location. In fact, David Fitzgerald  testified that in his experience as a Border Patrol Agent, never had  he encountered a modification like that on appellant's truck which  did not serve an illegal purpose.\n\nVehicle  Registration\n\nPrior  to the stop, David Fitzgerald ran a license and vehicle registration check  on appellant's truck. David Fitzgerald discovered the vehicle was  registered in Edna, Texas. David Fitzgerald testified that in his  experience, several of the alien-smuggling    vehicles he apprehended in the past originated from Edna, a suburb  of Dallas. See (citing border patrol's experience that many smugglers travel en  route to larger cities such as Austin, San  Antonio ,  and Dallas, and thus vehicle registration in Dallas to an individual  other than the defendant contributed to patrol's decision to detain  vehicle)."

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

The stop took place in Cotulla, Texas, approximately sixty-eight miles from the Texas-Mexico border. Conversing with Carlos Martinez-Romero in both Spanish and English, David Fitzgerald requested that Carlos Martinez-Romero produce proof of citizenship. Carlos Martinez-Romero presented proper proof of Mexican citizenship as well as a valid border-crosser card. While standing by the vehicle, David Fitzgerald noticed the strong odor of carpet freshener and observed freshener sprinkled on the floorboard of the truck. Suspecting that Carlos Martinez-Romero used the deodorizer to eliminate the scent of illegal drugs, David Fitzgerald obtained Carlos Martinez-Romero's consent to examine a toolbox located in the back of the truck. Although Carlos Martinez-Romero denied possessing the key, David Fitzgerald opened the toolbox with a key attached to the ignition and found six bundles of marijuana totaling one hundred and sixty-nine pounds. David Fitzgerald arrested Carlos Martinez-Romero for illegal drug possession. A jury found Carlos Martinez-Romero guilty of possession and imposed a sentence of seven years imprisonment. In a single issue, Carlos Martinez-Romero argues no reasonable suspicion existed to authorize the stop and therefore the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of marijuana at trial.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW"

  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

In fact, David Fitzgerald  testified that in his experience as a Border Patrol Agent, never had  he encountered a modification like that on appellant's truck which  did not serve an illegal purpose.\n\nVehicle  Registration\n\nPrior  to the stop, David Fitzgerald ran a license and vehicle registration check  on appellant's truck. David Fitzgerald discovered the vehicle was  registered in Edna, Texas. David Fitzgerald testified that in his  experience, several of the alien-smuggling    vehicles he apprehended in the past originated from Edna, a suburb  of Dallas. See (citing border patrol's experience that many smugglers travel en  route to larger cities such as Austin, San  Antonio ,  and Dallas, and thus vehicle registration in Dallas to an individual  other than the defendant contributed to patrol's decision to detain  vehicle)."

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

Example:
{

  "CHUNK_TEXT": "At approximately noon on May 24, 1998, Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald conducted an investigatory stop of Carlos Martinez-Romero as he traveled north on Interstate 35 in a crew-cab truck. The stop took place in Cotulla, Texas, approximately sixty-eight miles from the Texas-Mexico border. Conversing with Carlos Martinez-Romero in both Spanish and English, David Fitzgerald requested that Carlos Martinez-Romero produce proof of citizenship. Carlos Martinez-Romero presented proper proof of Mexican citizenship as well as a valid border-crosser card. While standing by the vehicle, David Fitzgerald noticed the strong odor of carpet freshener and observed freshener sprinkled on the floorboard of the truck. Suspecting that Carlos Martinez-Romero used the deodorizer to eliminate the scent of illegal drugs, David Fitzgerald obtained Carlos Martinez-Romero's consent to examine a toolbox located in the back of the truck. Although Carlos Martinez-Romero denied possessing the key, David Fitzgerald opened the toolbox with a key attached to the ignition and found six bundles of marijuana totaling one hundred and sixty-nine pounds. David Fitzgerald arrested Carlos Martinez-Romero for illegal drug possession. A jury found Carlos Martinez-Romero guilty of possession and imposed a sentence of seven years imprisonment. In a single issue, Carlos Martinez-Romero argues no reasonable suspicion existed to authorize the stop and therefore the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of marijuana at trial.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW"

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

In fact, David Fitzgerald  testified that in his experience as a Border Patrol Agent, never had  he encountered a modification like that on appellant's truck which  did not serve an illegal purpose.\n\nVehicle  Registration\n\nPrior  to the stop, David Fitzgerald ran a license and vehicle registration check  on appellant's truck. David Fitzgerald discovered the vehicle was  registered in Edna, Texas. David Fitzgerald testified that in his  experience, several of the alien-smuggling    vehicles he apprehended in the past originated from Edna, a suburb  of Dallas. See (citing border patrol's experience that many smugglers travel en  route to larger cities such as Austin, San  Antonio ,  and Dallas, and thus vehicle registration in Dallas to an individual  other than the defendant contributed to patrol's decision to detain  vehicle)."

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.
