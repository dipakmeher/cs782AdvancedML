David Fitzgerald cited the modification to the back seat of Carlos Martinez-Romero's crew-cab truck as another articulated reason for conducting the stop. When United States Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald first passed Carlos Martinez-Romero he observed that the modified back seat area of Carlos Martinez-Romero's crew-cab truck was missing. As discussed earlier, consistent with the agent's testimony regarding previous illegal alien and narcotics stops, often the modified back seat area of Carlos Martinez-Romero's crew-cab truck provides the stow-away location. In fact, United States Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald testified that in his experience as a Border Patrol Agent, never had he encountered a modification like that on Carlos Martinez-Romero's crew-cab truck which did not serve an illegal purpose.
