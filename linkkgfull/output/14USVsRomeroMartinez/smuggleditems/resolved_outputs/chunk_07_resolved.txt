Prior to the stop, United States Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald ran a license and vehicle registration check on Carlos Martinez-Romero's crew-cab truck. United States Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald discovered Carlos Martinez-Romero's crew-cab truck was registered in Edna, Texas. United States Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald testified that in his experience, several of the alien-smuggling vehicles he apprehended in the past originated from Edna, a suburb of Dallas. See (citing border patrol's experience that many smugglers travel en route to larger cities such as Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas, and thus vehicle registration in Dallas to an individual other than Carlos Martinez-Romero contributed to patrol's decision to detain Carlos Martinez-Romero's crew-cab truck).

When we consider all of these factors under the Woods totality of the circumstances test, we hold the trial court in the case of Carlos Martinez-Romero properly determined that reasonable suspicion existed to justify the stop. The agent's experience, Carlos Martinez-Romero's crew-cab truck's registration and physical characteristics, appellant's behavior, and the inferences that could be drawn from these facts, established reasonable suspicion. Accordingly, we overrule Carlos Martinez-Romero's sole issue and affirm the trial court in the case of Carlos Martinez-Romero's judgment.
