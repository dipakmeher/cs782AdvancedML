Agent David Fitzgerald testified that in his four years of experience as a United States Border Patrol Agent, crew-cab trucks missing a backseat, similar to that which Carlos Martinez-Romero drove, invariably indicate the stowage of illegal aliens or narcotics. United States Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald testified, "I've never seen a vehicle that was modified in such a way that was not used for either transporting illegal aliens or narcotics."

Carlos Martinez-Romero stresses that United States Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald was not a credible witness because he only conducted one other narcotics arrest. Further, Carlos Martinez-Romero argued that United States Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald's testimony lacked credibility because the State failed to introduce the number of stops the agent made per week and the success rate of these stops. These allegations are unpersuasive on appeal because the trial court in the case of Carlos Martinez-Romero is the sole and exclusive trier of facts and the judge of the credibility of witnesses at suppression hearings.
