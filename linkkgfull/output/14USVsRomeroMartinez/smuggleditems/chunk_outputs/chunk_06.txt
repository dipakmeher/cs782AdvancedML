David Fitzgerald cited the modification to the modified backseat of the crew-cab truck used by Carlos Martinez-Romero as another articulated reason for conducting the stop. When United States Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald first passed Carlos Martinez-Romero he observed that the missing back seat of the crew-cab truck used by Carlos Martinez-Romero was missing. As discussed earlier, consistent with the agent's testimony regarding previous illegal alien and narcotics stops, often the back seat area of the crew-cab truck used by Carlos Martinez-Romero provides the stow-away location. In fact, United States Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald testified that in his experience as a Border Patrol Agent, never had he encountered a modification like that on the crew-cab truck used by Carlos Martinez-Romero which did not serve an illegal purpose.
