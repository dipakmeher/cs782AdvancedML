Carlos Martinez-Romero was convicted of possession of marijuana. On appeal Carlos Martinez-Romero argues the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress evidence of the marijuana. Carlos Martinez-Romero based his motion to suppress on a lack of reasonable suspicion for a vehicle stop at the U.S.-Mexico border. Because we agree with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that enough factors existed to justify the stop under the totality of the circumstances, we affirm the trial court's judgment.
