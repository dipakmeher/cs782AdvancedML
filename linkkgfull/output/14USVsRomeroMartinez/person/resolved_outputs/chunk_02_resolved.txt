At approximately noon on May 24, 1998, Border Patrol Agent David Fitzgerald conducted an investigatory stop of Carlos Martinez-Romero as he traveled north on Interstate 35 in a crew-cab truck. The stop took place in Cotulla, Texas, approximately sixty-eight miles from the Texas-Mexico border. Conversing with Carlos Martinez-Romero in both Spanish and English, David Fitzgerald requested that Carlos Martinez-Romero produce proof of citizenship. Carlos Martinez-Romero presented proper proof of Mexican citizenship as well as a valid border-crosser card. While standing by the vehicle, David Fitzgerald noticed the strong odor of carpet freshener and observed freshener sprinkled on the floorboard of the truck. Suspecting that Carlos Martinez-Romero used the deodorizer to eliminate the scent of illegal drugs, David Fitzgerald obtained Carlos Martinez-Romero's consent to examine a toolbox located in the back of the truck. Although Carlos Martinez-Romero denied possessing the key, David Fitzgerald opened the toolbox with a key attached to the ignition and found six bundles of marijuana totaling one hundred and sixty-nine pounds. David Fitzgerald arrested Carlos Martinez-Romero for illegal drug possession. A jury found Carlos Martinez-Romero guilty of possession and imposed a sentence of seven years imprisonment. In a single issue, Carlos Martinez-Romero argues no reasonable suspicion existed to authorize the stop and therefore the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of marijuana at trial.
