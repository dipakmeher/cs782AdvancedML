As  one of the stated reasons for the stop, Agent Fitzgerald noticed  that appellant was traveling at a very low rate of speed when  Fitzgerald first passed him. Fitzgerald testified that appellant  traveled approximately fifty miles per hour on IH-35 where the  stated speed limit was seventy miles per hour. Additionally,  Fitzgerald observed that appellant appeared very tense and rigid.  When Fitzgerald turned his vehicle around to follow appellant, he  testified that appellant consistently looked in his rear-view mirror  and weaved within his lane. Further, Fitzgerald testified that as he  pulled alongside appellant's truck, appellant moved away from the  wheel    and attempted to position himself between the door jamb in between  the front door and the crew-cab section of the truck. While glances  in one's rear-view mirror do not necessarily constitute peculiar  behavior, we agree that appellant's attempts to hide himself from  Fitzgerald's view qualify as a suspicious activity.
