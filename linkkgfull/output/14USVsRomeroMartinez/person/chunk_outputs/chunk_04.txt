Agent  Fitzgerald testified that in his four years of experience as a  Border Patrol Agent, crew-cab trucks missing a backseat, similar to  that which the appellant drove, invariably indicate the stowage of  illegal aliens or narcotics. Fitzgerald testified, "I've never  seen a vehicle that was modified in such a way that was not used for  either transporting illegal aliens or narcotics."

Appellant  stresses that Agent Fitzgerald was not a credible witness  because    he only conducted one other narcotics arrest. Further, appellant  argued that Agent Fitzgerald's testimony lacked credibility because  the State failed to introduce the number of stops the agent made per  week and the success rate of these stops. These allegations are  unpersuasive on appeal because   the trial judge is the sole and exclusive trier of facts and the  judge of the credibility of witnesses at suppression hearings. See .
