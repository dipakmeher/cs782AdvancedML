Carlos Martinez-Romero is a Appellant.

Appellant  Carlos Martinez-Romero was convicted of possession of marijuana. On  appeal appellant argues the trial court erred in overruling his  motion to suppress evidence of the marijuana. Appellant based his  motion to suppress on a lack of reasonable suspicion for a vehicle  stop at the border. Because we agree with the trial court that  enough factors existed to justify the stop under the totality of the  circumstances, we affirm the trial court's judgment.
