At  approximately noon on May 24, 1998, Border Patrol Agent David  Fitzgerald conducted an investigatory stop of appellant as he  traveled north on Interstate 35 in a crew-cab truck. The stop took  place in Cotulla, Texas, approximately sixty-eight miles from    the Texas-Mexico border. Conversing with appellant in both Spanish  and English, Agent Fitzgerald requested that appellant produce proof  of citizenship. Appellant presented proper proof of Mexican  citizenship as well as a valid border-crosser card. While standing  by the vehicle, Agent Fitzgerald noticed the strong odor of carpet  freshener and observed freshener sprinkled on the floorboard of the  truck. Suspecting that appellant used the deodorizer to eliminate  the scent of illegal drugs, Agent Fitzgerald obtained appellant's  consent to examine a toolbox located in the back of the truck.  Although appellant denied possessing the key, Agent Fitzgerald  opened the toolbox with a key attached to the ignition and found six  bundles of marijuana totaling one hundred and sixty-nine pounds.  Fitzgerald arrested appellant for illegal drug possession. A jury  found appellant guilty of possession and imposed a sentence of seven  years imprisonment. In a single issue, appellant argues no  reasonable suspicion existed to authorize the stop and therefore the  trial court erred in admitting the evidence of marijuana at trial.
