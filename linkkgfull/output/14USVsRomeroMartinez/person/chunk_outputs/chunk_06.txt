Fitzgerald  cited the modification to the crew-cab's backseat as another  articulated reason for conducting the stop. When Fitzgerald first  passed appellant he observed that the back seat was missing. As  discussed earlier, consistent with the agent's testimony regarding  previous illegal alien and narcotics stops, often the back seat area  of crew-cabs provides the stow-away location. In fact, Fitzgerald  testified that in his experience as a Border Patrol Agent, never had  he encountered a modification like that on appellant's truck which  did not serve an illegal purpose.

Vehicle  Registration

Prior  to the stop, Fitzgerald ran a license and vehicle registration check  on appellant's truck. Fitzgerald discovered the vehicle was  registered in Edna, Texas. Fitzgerald testified that in his  experience, several of the alien-smuggling    vehicles he apprehended in the past originated from Edna, a suburb  of Dallas. See (citing border patrol's experience that many smugglers travel en  route to larger cities such as Austin, San  Antonio ,  and Dallas, and thus vehicle registration in Dallas to an individual  other than the defendant contributed to patrol's decision to detain  vehicle).
