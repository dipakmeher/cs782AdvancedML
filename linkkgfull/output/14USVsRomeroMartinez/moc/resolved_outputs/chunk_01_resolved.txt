Carlos Martinez-Romero was convicted of possession of marijuana. On appeal Carlos Martinez-Romero argues the trial court in the case of Carlos Martinez-Romero erred in overruling his motion to suppress evidence of the marijuana. Carlos Martinez-Romero based his motion to suppress on a lack of reasonable suspicion for the crew-cab truck used by Carlos Martinez-Romero stop at the U.S.-Mexico border. Because we agree with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that enough factors existed to justify the stop under the Woods totality of the circumstances test, we affirm the trial court in the case of Carlos Martinez-Romero's judgment.
