We find the United States of America's untimeliness should not be excused here. This United States Court of Appeals has never treated or recognized the United States of America's filing of an untimely motion within the 30-day additional period contemplated by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure as a motion for a determination of excusable neglect or good cause. Whether this United States Court of Appeals would do so is not before us because the United States of America advanced no such argument. However, even if we were to treat the United States of America's untimely appeal as a motion for a determination of excusable neglect or good cause, we find no excusable neglect or good cause for its tardiness here. Likewise, the United States of America's case here is easily distinguishable from not only because there the United States of America timely appealed the United States District Court's second quashing order (albeit with the certification flaw) within the 30 days as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure, but also because we find no 'equities in this appeal which favor the United States of America.'
