We now consider the United States of America's argument that a post-verdict suppression order fails to become material to the proceedings until the United States of America decides to grant acquittal. We find this argument lacks merit. Rule 4(b)(1)(B)(i) requires filing of notice of appeal 'within 30 days after . . . the entry of the judgment or order being appealed.' Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(B)(i). For appealing the denial of the motion for reconsideration of granting suppression entered on August 12, 2003, the deadline for the United States of America was September 11, 2003. The language of does not extend or toll this deadline in any way, nor does it hinder the United States of America from appealing within 30 days; it also does not suggest that materiality is a different inquiry when a suppression is made pre-as opposed to post-verdict.
