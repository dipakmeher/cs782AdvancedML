The United States of America concedes that if the clock started on August 12, it did fail to meet the 30-day deadline. However, the United States of America points to the materiality requirement in Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(B)(i) and argues that the outcome of the motion to suppress the cocaine by itself did not have any legal effect on the prior guilty verdict and thus had no practical 'material' effect on the proceedings against Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso until the United States of America granted Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso's motion for judgment of acquittal or new trial. Thus, the United States of America contends the real clock began with the entry of the judgment for acquittal entered on August 29, 2003, both for appealing the suppression and the acquittal. The United States of America is correct that appealing the decision to suppress per Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(B)(i) would be possible here, notwithstanding the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b) timing problem.
