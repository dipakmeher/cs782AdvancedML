Agent Jesus Garcia stated he asked these questions because certain cities are common destinations for illegal aliens and 'disposable' vehicles are often used for smuggling drugs or aliens. He also stated that 1996 Mercury Cougar vehicles have been used for alien smuggling because of their large trunk and a void in the quarter panels, and freshly cleaned cars, such as Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso's 1996 Mercury Cougar, suggest they have been wiped down for residue or odor.

2. United States of America has held that the 30 days start with the entry of the judgment or order in the docket per Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b), not the rendering of the judgment or order per. Here, the dates of rendering and entry for reconsideration of the suppression are the same (August 12) and for the acquittal are one day apart (rendered on August 28, entered on August 29).

3. United States of America has met United States of America's other requirements. United States of America expressly allows for the United States of America's appeal from orders suppressing evidence; here, the cocaine discovered in the 1996 Mercury Cougar was suppressed by a United States District Court. Suppression must not be made 'after the defendant has been put in jeopardy and before the verdict'; this is also met here because the order was entered after the bench trial ended and the United States of America entered its guilty verdict. See (explaining that forbids the interruption of trial). The United States of America also made the proper certifications in the United States of America's joint notice of appeal filed on September 25, 2003 per Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure.
