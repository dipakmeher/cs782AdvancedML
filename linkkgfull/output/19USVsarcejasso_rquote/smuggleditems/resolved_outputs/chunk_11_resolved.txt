We now consider the United States of America's argument regarding post-verdict suppression order that a post-verdict suppression order in the case of Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso fails to become material to the legal proceedings against Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso until the United States of America decides to grant acquittal. We find this argument lacks merit. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(B)(i) requires filing of the notice of appeal 'within 30 days after . . . the entry of the judgment or order being appealed.' Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(B)(i). For appealing the denial of the motion for reconsideration of granting suppression entered on August 12, 2003, which is the United States of America's motion for reconsideration of the decision to suppress the cocaine, the deadline for the United States of America was September 11, 2003. The language of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(B)(i) does not extend or toll this deadline in any way, nor does it hinder the United States of America from appealing within 30 days; it also does not suggest that materiality is a different inquiry when a suppression is made pre-as opposed to post-verdict.
