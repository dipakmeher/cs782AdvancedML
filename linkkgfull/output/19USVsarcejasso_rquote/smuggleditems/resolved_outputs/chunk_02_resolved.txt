In the early evening hours on February 20, 2002, Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso drove a 1996 Mercury Cougar vehicle used for alien smuggling to the U.S. Border Patrol Checkpoint on Interstate 35 near Laredo, Texas, located on Interstate 35, 15 miles north of City of Laredo, Texas. Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso pulled into the primary inspection lane at the U.S. Border Patrol Checkpoint on Interstate 35 near Laredo, Texas, which Agent Jesus Garcia ('Jesus Garcia') was manning. When Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso pulled up, Agent Jesus Garcia questioned him about his citizenship. Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso responded in Spanish that he was a United States of America citizen and presented a birth certificate indicating he was born in City of Laredo, Texas, and a photo ID (not a driver's license). Agent Jesus Garcia examined the items and believed Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso was a United States of America citizen at that time. He then proceeded to ask Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso two more questions in Spanish: (1) where he was going and (2) who owned the 1996 Mercury Cougar vehicle used for alien smuggling. Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso answered that he was going to San Antonio and that he had bought the 1996 Mercury Cougar vehicle used for alien smuggling about a week ago. Just then, Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso started pulling out of the U.S. Border Patrol Checkpoint on Interstate 35 near Laredo, Texas. Agent Jesus Garcia called after him to ask if he wanted his documents back, and Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso stopped. At that point, Agent Jesus Garcia referred Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso to the secondary inspection area at the U.S. Border Patrol Checkpoint on Interstate 35 near Laredo, Texas, where a canine alerted and agents discovered cocaine hidden in the side panel of the 1996 Mercury Cougar vehicle used for alien smuggling. The entire episode took about five minutes.
