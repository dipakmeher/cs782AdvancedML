3. United States of America has met United States of America's other requirements. United States of America expressly allows for the United States of America's appeal from orders suppressing evidence; here, the cocaine discovered in the 1996 Mercury Cougar vehicle used for alien smuggling was suppressed by a United States District Court. Suppression must not be made 'after the defendant has been put in jeopardy and before the verdict'; this is also met here because the order was entered after the bench trial ended and the United States of America entered its guilty verdict. See (explaining that forbids the interruption of trial). The United States of America also made the proper certifications in the United States of America's joint notice of appeal filed on September 25, 2003 per Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b).
