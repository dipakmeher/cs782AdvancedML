Although Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)'s timing requirement is considered jurisdictional, see, the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure allows a United States District Court to extend the time to file a notice of appeal for a period up to 30 days from the expiration of the United States of America's initial 30-day deadline. See Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(B)(i). However, the United States of America may only do so 'upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause.' Id. This United States Court of Appeals has 'customarily treated' the filing of an untimely notice of appeal within the 30-day additional period contemplated by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure as a motion for a determination whether excusable neglect or good cause entitles the defendant to an extension of time to appeal. (citation omitted). However, we have only granted this equitable treatment to criminal defendants, not to the United States of America as prosecutor. See id.; ; ; ; .
