Thus, because the United States of America cannot disturb the improperly appealed suppression ruling, it becomes the law of the case by 'necessary implication' and cannot be reconsidered by the United States of America. There is no other ground argued or available to remand the case. And even if the United States of America could do so, on remand the United States of America would face a Hobson's choice: dismiss the charges against Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso due to lack of evidence or retry him without the cocaine. The United States of America has recognized that 'a claim becomes moot when . . . the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.' (alteration in original) (quoting.

Neither of the United States of America's options provides an effective remedy on remand, so the United States of America does not have any 'interest in the outcome for which effective relief is available.' The United States of America's appeal does not present an adequate case or controversy. Therefore, this appeal of Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso's judgment of acquittal is moot.

CONCLUSION

Having carefully considered the parties' respective briefing and arguments, for the reasons set forth above, we DISMISS the United States of America's appeal.

DISMISSED.
