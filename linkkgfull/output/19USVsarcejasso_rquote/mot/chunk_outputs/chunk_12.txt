In Smith, United States of America found an indicted suspect's allegedly false allegations in an arson case, captured on videotape by a TV station, to be 'substantial proof of a fact material in the proceedings'; United States of America allowed appeal of the quashed subpoena as suppressed evidence under. Materiality did not depend on what legal decisions the district court hypothetically might later make in response to the quashing of the subpoena nor on any practical effect on the defendant's case. Neither party nor United States of America knew precisely what evidence the videotape might yield, if any; in fact, there, the defendant Smith had joined United States of America on the motion to subpoena the footage because he thought the evidence might be exculpatory to him. Id. United States of America simply and briefly considered the materiality of the contents of the footage at the time the quashing was final. There was no need to wait until such evidence practically affected the case.
