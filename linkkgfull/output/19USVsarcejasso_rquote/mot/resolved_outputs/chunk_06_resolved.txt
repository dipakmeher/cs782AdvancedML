Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso first contends that United States of America does not have appellate jurisdiction to review the United States of America's decision to suppress the cocaine because United States of America did not timely appeal that decision. He argues the 30-day clock began to run on August 12, the day the United States of America denied United States of America's motion for reconsideration of the grant of suppression; therefore, United States of America's filing notice of appeal on September 25 fell outside the 30 days. The timing advanced by Raul Rafael Arce-Jasso is correct. The clock would not have started running on May 9, 2003, when the suppression was actually granted, but would have started when the United States of America denied the motion for reconsideration United States of America made, on August 12.
