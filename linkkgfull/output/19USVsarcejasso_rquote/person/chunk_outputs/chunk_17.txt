Thus, because   this Court cannot disturb the improperly appealed suppression  ruling, it becomes the law of the case by 'necessary  implication' and cannot be reconsidered by the district court.  There is no other ground argued or available to remand the case. And  even if this Court could do so, on remand the Government would face  a Hobson's choice :  dismiss the charges against Arce-Jasso due to lack of evidence or  retry him without the cocaine. This Court has recognized that   'a claim becomes moot when . . . the parties lack a legally  cognizable interest in the outcome.' (alteration in original) (quoting .

Neither of the Government's options provides an effective remedy on  remand, so the Government does not have any 'interest in the  outcome for which effective relief is available.' .  The Government's appeal does not present an adequate case or  controversy. Therefore, this appeal of Arce-Jasso's judgment of  acquittal is moot.

CONCLUSION

Having  carefully considered the parties' respective briefing and arguments,  for the    reasons set forth above, we DISMISS the Government's appeal.

DISMISSED.
