We  now consider the Government's argument that a post-verdict  suppression order fails to become material to the proceedings until  the court decides to grant acquittal.   We find this argument lacks merit.     Rule  4(b)(1)(B)(i) requires filing of notice of appeal 'within 30 days after . . .  the entry of the judgment or order being appealed.' FED.  R. APP. P. 4(b)(1)(B)(i) .  For appealing the denial of the motion for reconsideration of  granting suppression entered on August 12, 2003, the deadline for  the Government was September 11, 2003. The language of does not extend or toll this deadline in any way, nor does it hinder  the Government from appealing within 30 days; it also does not  suggest that materiality is a different inquiry when a suppression  is made pre-as opposed to post-verdict.
