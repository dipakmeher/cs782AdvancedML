In Smith ,  this Court found an indicted suspect's allegedly false allegations  in an arson case, captured on videotape by a TV station, to be  'substantial proof of a fact material in the proceedings';  this Court allowed appeal of the quashed subpoena as suppressed  evidence under . .  Materiality did not depend on what legal decisions the district  court hypothetically might later make in response to the quashing of  the subpoena nor on any practical effect on the defendant's case.  Neither party nor this Court knew precisely    what evidence the videotape might yield, if any; in fact, there, the  defendant Smith had joined the Government on the motion to subpoena  the footage because he thought the evidence might be exculpatory to  him. Id. This Court simply and briefly considered the materiality    of the contents of the footage at the time the quashing was final. There was no need to wait until such evidence practically affected  the case.
