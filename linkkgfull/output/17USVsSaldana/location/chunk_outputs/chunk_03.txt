Gary Haston testified to a number of other observations he made. He noticed the scissor lift had received a new paint job and observed the battery charger area had a new over-coating of paint. See Def. Ex. 2. Gary Haston also observed the truck was outfitted with what he considered over-sized tires and after-market rims, which he found atypical for trucks pulling a heavy piece of machinery. See Def. Ex. 1. Gary Haston also testified that in his experience large, after-market rims are often used to hide loads of narcotics. Gary Haston further noted two pieces of steel had been placed under the wheels of the scissor lift, which Gary Haston interpreted to mean the scissor lift would be on the trailer for a long time—consistent, according to Gary Haston, with drug trafficking. See Def. Ex. 2.
