As for the second factor, there is minimal indication of coercive police procedures. The stop began as a routine traffic encounter. Jason Cox and Federico Saldana engaged in a cooperative, polite conversation regarding Federico Saldana's traffic violations, the ownership of the truck and trailer, and the itinerary of Federico Saldana's trip. Gary Haston also asked Federico Saldana many questions, and Federico Saldana was ready and willing to answer all of them. Gary Haston's manner certainly became more aggressive as his suspicions grew, but his conduct did not amount to coercion. Gary Haston openly informed Federico Saldana of his belief as to the presence of narcotics, and Gary Haston applied some pressure in attempting to elicit Federico Saldana's cooperation. For instance, Gary Haston made the following statements: "this is gonna be a turning point in life for you, and it's gonna start right now"; "we're gonna find the dope, and your cooperation is going to matter a lot"; "it's going to be a lot less stressful for you if you start cooperating from this point"; "if there's a load of dope, we're gonna find it"; and "how much is there? Cause you know I know." While Federico Saldana showed signs of nervousness, he continued to answer the questions and persisted in denying the presence of any drugs.
