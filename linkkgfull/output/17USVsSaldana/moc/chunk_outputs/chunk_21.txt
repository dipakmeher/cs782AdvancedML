As a narcotics investigator with 17 years of experience, including hundreds of interdiction cases, Williamson County Sheriff's Office strongly suspected Federico Saldana was transporting a load of dope and started inquiring into Federico Saldana's criminal history. Williamson County Sheriff's Office learned Federico Saldana had previously smuggled aliens and drugs using his 18-wheeler. Williamson County Sheriff's Office told Federico Saldana that he suspected Federico Saldana was again transporting drugs. Williamson County Sheriff's Office urged Federico Saldana to cooperate and directly asked if he were moving drugs, which Federico Saldana denied. Williamson County Sheriff's Office responded by asking if Federico Saldana objected to or had any problem with the officers searching his 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer, and Federico Saldana stated he had no objection and no problem. Taken together, from the time Williamson County Sheriff's Office stopped Federico Saldana for the traffic violations to the point where Federico Saldana gave his consent to search, additional reasonable suspicion arose for Williamson County Sheriff's Office both through his observations and conversations. Williamson County Sheriff's Office had yet to either dispel or confirm these accumulating suspicions as of that time, and he could validly prolong the detention in order to address these concerns.

III. The Consent was Voluntary and Never Revoked
