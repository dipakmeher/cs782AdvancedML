Ultimately, Williamson County Sheriff's Office asked: "Do you have any objection if we search the truck and trailer?" Federico Saldana responded he did not. Forty seconds later, Williamson County Sheriff's Office again confirmed: "So you don't have any problems if we search the truck and trailer?" Federico Saldana said he had no problem. While Williamson County Sheriff's Office did not specifically tell Federico Saldana he had a right to refuse his search request, both of Williamson County Sheriff's Office's questions indicated Federico Saldana could either object to, or express a problem with, a search. See (finding it is "particularly worth noting" that the law enforcement specifically advised the subject he had a right to refuse consent to search his luggage). Federico Saldana, with no hesitation or seeming concern, gave Williamson County Sheriff's Office his consent to look for drugs in the truck and trailer. There is no indication in the record that Federico Saldana ever expressed concern or confusion over his consent. Instead, Federico Saldana remained cooperative throughout the process, including driving the truck and trailer to the rest stop for the dog search and further driving the truck and trailer to the tire shop for more thorough searching. It cannot be said Federico Saldana merely submitted to overpowering authority. See (noting orderly submission to law enforcement who falsely represented to defendant they had authority to conduct search pursuant to a warrant was not valid consent); (concluding that in circumstances involving a 17-year-old boy awakened in his bedroom at 3:00 a.m. by police officers who told him "we need to go and talk," his response of "okay" was not regarded as consent but a "mere submission to authority"). In sum, Federico Saldana's consent was not the product of coercion.
