However, upon re-examining the provided text and the RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary for accuracy in replacement:

The original text does not directly mention "the Government" or other aliases that need replacement with their full names as per the RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary. The mentions of entities like "Williamson County Sheriff's Office" are already explicit and do not require replacement based on the given instructions.

Given this, the corrected approach to resolving coreferences according to the provided instructions would result in minimal changes since most references are either already explicit or do not match the aliases provided for replacement.

The mention of "Gov't" could potentially be seen as an alias for "Government," which is mapped to "United States." However, given the strict instruction to only replace exact matches and considering the context where "Gov't" is used (as part of "Gov't Ex."), it's reasonable to interpret this as an abbreviation in a legal citation rather than a direct reference to the entity that needs replacement.

Therefore, the coreference-resolved version of the input text, following the instructions precisely and making replacements only where explicitly directed by the RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary, would remain largely unchanged from the original TEXT_CHUNK provided.
