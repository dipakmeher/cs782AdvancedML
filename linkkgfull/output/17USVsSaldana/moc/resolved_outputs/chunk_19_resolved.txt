Considering these circumstances, the detention did not exceed its original scope. In a valid traffic stop, an officer can request a driver's license of Federico Saldana, insurance papers, vehicle registration of the 2008 Chevrolet truck, run computer checks thereon using the computer used by Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer, and issue a citation or warning. See. Gary Haston's questioning occurred while Jason Cox was still in the process of gathering the relevant information to complete the warning paperwork and therefore did not extend the initial valid seizure beyond a reasonable duration. In other words, as of the time Federico Saldana gave his consent, the detention continued to be supported by the facts that justified the traffic stop.
