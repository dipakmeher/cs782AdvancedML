According to Williamson County Sheriff's Office, the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana was traveling at approximately 75 miles per hour, and it changed lanes multiple times in an unsafe manner. Williamson County Sheriff's Office described the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana as both following vehicles at an unsafe distance in the lane it occupied, and changing lanes into tight spaces where the trailing car in the lane into which the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana had just moved had to brake to avoid running into the back of the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck. Williamson County Sheriff's Office referenced two near-collisions he witnessed. Based on these observations, Williamson County Sheriff's Office and Williamson County Sheriff's Office contacted a patrol deputy in a marked unit, specifically Josiah Bennett's patrol car, to conduct a traffic stop.
