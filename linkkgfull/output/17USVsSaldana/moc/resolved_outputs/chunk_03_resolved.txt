Gary Haston testified to a number of other observations he made. He noticed the scissor lift had received a new paint job and observed the battery charger area had a new over-coating of paint. See Def. Ex. 2. Williamson County Sheriff's Office also observed the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana was outfitted with what he considered over-sized tires and after-market rims, which he found atypical for 2008 Chevrolet trucks pulling a heavy piece of machinery. See Def. Ex. 1. Williamson County Sheriff's Office also testified that in his experience large, after-market rims are often used to hide loads of narcotics. Williamson County Sheriff's Office further noted two pieces of steel had been placed under the wheels of the scissor lift, which Williamson County Sheriff's Office interpreted to mean the scissor lift would be on the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck for a long time—consistent, according to Williamson County Sheriff's Office, with drug trafficking.
