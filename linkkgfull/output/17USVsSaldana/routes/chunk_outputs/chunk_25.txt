Taking all six of the factors into consideration, the Court concludes the consent was voluntary and valid, and Federico Saldana never revoked his consent even as Jason Cox and Gary Haston increased the intrusiveness of the search. Therefore, the does not apply to the events occurring after Federico Saldana's voluntary consent.

Conclusion

Jason Cox had reasonable suspicion Federico Saldana had committed a traffic violation when he initiated the stop. Within fifteen minutes—and before Jason Cox had completed the initial purpose of the stop by issuing the warning citation—Federico Saldana had voluntarily consented to a search of the truck and trailer. Moreover, Jason Cox and Gary Haston developed additional reasonable suspicion of potential drug trafficking through their observations and conversations with Federico Saldana, and they had yet to dispel or confirm these suspicions as of the time Federico Saldana gave his valid consent. As such, the officers were justified in prolonging the stop during those initial fifteen minutes and through the moment of consent. Federico Saldana never revoked his consent, and Jason Cox and Gary Haston ultimately discovered the secreted cocaine. Federico Saldana's rights were not violated, and therefore his motion to suppress the drugs and his statements to law enforcement after the discovery of the drugs must be denied.

Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Defendant Federico Saldana's Motion to Suppress #24 is DENIED.
