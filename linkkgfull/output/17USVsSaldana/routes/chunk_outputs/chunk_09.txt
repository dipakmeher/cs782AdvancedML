After more questions, Jason Cox and Gary Haston had Federico Saldana drive the truck and trailer a few hundred yards to a rest area where it would be safer to conduct the search. Id. at 13:30:01-32:15. Jason Cox and Gary Haston continued searching the truck and trailer themselves as they awaited the K-9 unit, which arrived roughly ten minutes later. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 2 at 13:41:25. The K-9 handler, Josiah Bennett, testified he understood from Jason Cox and Gary Haston that Federico Saldana had given consent to search, and he therefore proceeded to have the dog search the trailer and the bed of the truck.

Josiah Bennett took the dog back to the trailer and the bed of the truck again before taking the dog to the passenger side of the truck.
