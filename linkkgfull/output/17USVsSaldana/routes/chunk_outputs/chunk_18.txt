Moreover, in the alternative, Gary Haston's suspicions regarding potential drug trafficking were ever-increasing as the first fifteen minutes of the stop unfolded. Indeed, Gary Haston's suspicions began before he saw Federico Saldana committing multiple traffic violations. Gary Haston noticed the recently registered license plates and ran checks on them, discovering the trailer's license plate had been registered in Laredo four days earlier to Daniel Martin Huerta while the truck's license plate had been registered four months earlier in San Antonio to Daniel A. Huerta. Gary Haston observed the erratic driving consistent with an individual perhaps unfamiliar with driving this sort of truck and trailer combination. Gary Haston noted the oversized tires and after-market rims, which he considered unusual for this type of machinery hauling. Gary Haston observed a new paint job for the scissor lift and the battery charger area as well as corrugated metal plates under the tires of the scissor left. All of these factors continued to build Gary Haston's suspicions there might be a load of narcotics hidden in the truck or the trailer. Gary Haston's suspicions only continued to grow as he questioned Federico Saldana about his trip. Troubling statements from Federico Saldana included: (1) he was not the owner of the truck or trailer; (2) he had trouble recalling the owner's name; (3) he was driving a heavy piece of machinery over 400 miles from Laredo to Dallas for repairs; (4) he did not know the exact address of his ultimate destination in Dallas; (5) he was supposed to call the owner upon arrival in Dallas to find out the actual address; (6) he was hauling the scissor lift as a favor to the owner and apparently for $300; (7) he was not used to driving a truck and trailer combination; and (8) he did not know the name of the owner's painting company.
