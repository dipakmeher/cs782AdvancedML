At approximately 12:59 p.m., Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer, responding to the traffic violation information provided by Williamson County Sheriff's Office and Williamson County Sheriff's Office, pulled up behind the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana traveling in the far right lane. See United States Government Ex. 1, Clip 1 at 12:59. Gary Haston testified that he could not recall whether Gary Haston relayed his drug suspicions at this time, but Gary Haston assumed the stop related to drugs because he was familiar with Gary Haston's work as a narcotics investigator. The flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck at one point momentarily veered onto Interstate 35 before returning inside the lane. Id. at 12:59:21. Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer initiated a traffic stop on Interstate 35, and the driver stepped out of the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana, meeting Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer to the right of the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana away from traffic. At 13:01:10. The driver identified himself as Federico Saldana. Federico Saldana indicated he was a truck driver by trade but was not used to driving this sort of truck and trailer combination. When asked who the owner of the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck were, Federico Saldana was not able to easily recall the owner's name but did indicate—although the audio from Deputy Jason Cox's patrol video recording is not entirely clear—the owner's first name was "Daniel."
