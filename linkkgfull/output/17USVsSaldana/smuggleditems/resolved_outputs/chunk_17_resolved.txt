Here, Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer testified it observed Federico Saldana having trouble maintaining the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck carrying a piece of heavy machinery in a single lane, and that Federico Saldana was changing lanes in an unsafe manner resulting in two near-collisions. Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer directly relayed this information to Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer, and Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer proceeded to locate Federico Saldana and conduct a traffic stop on Interstate 35. Therefore, Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer had an objectively reasonable suspicion Federico Saldana had committed multiple traffic violations as witnessed by Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer and Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer. In addition, Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer, upon locating the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck, witnessed the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck veering onto Interstate 35 before it initiated the traffic stop.

II. Second Prong of the Terry Test: The detention during traffic stop was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the traffic violation.
