Federico Saldana has moved to suppress the specific type of smuggled substance under his rights, arguing there was no reasonable suspicion to stop Federico Saldana in the first place, and contending there was no probable cause for the detention and subsequent search of the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck. The Court in the above-styled cause protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures; traffic stops are considered seizures within the meaning of the. ; . Because traffic stops are considered more similar to investigative detentions than formal arrests, Court in the above-styled cause analyze the legality of traffic stops for purposes under the standard articulated in. . This standard is a two-tiered reasonable suspicion inquiry: (1) whether the Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer's actions were justified at the stop's inception; and (2) whether the search or seizure was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop in the first place. ; . In addition, "the investigative methods employed should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer's suspicion in a short period of time." . Once a Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer's suspicions have been verified or dispelled, the detention during traffic stop must end unless there is additional articulable reasonable suspicion, but "at that point, continuation of the detention during traffic stop is no longer supported by the facts that justified its initiation." . Reasonable suspicion exists when the detaining Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer "can point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the search and seizure."
