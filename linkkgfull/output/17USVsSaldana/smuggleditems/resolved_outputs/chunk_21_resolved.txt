Considering these circumstances, the detention during traffic stop did not exceed its original scope. In a valid traffic stop on Interstate 35, a Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer can request Federico Saldana's driver's license, insurance papers, vehicle registration of the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana, run computer checks run by Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer thereon, and issue a citation or warning. See. Gary Haston's questioning conducted by Gary Haston occurred while Jason Cox was still in the process of gathering the relevant information to complete the warning paperwork and therefore did not extend the initial valid seizure beyond a reasonable duration. In other words, as of the time Federico Saldana gave his consent, the detention during traffic stop continued to be supported by the facts that justified the traffic violation.
