Although not apparent from the Williamson County Sheriff's Office video recording, according to Josiah Bennett's testimony, the K-9 dog used for searching alerted twice to the presence of narcotics. The first alert was to a set of tools on the floorboard of the front seat of the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana. The second alert was to clothes on the floorboard of the back seat of the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana. Comparing this testimony to the Williamson County Sheriff's Office video recording, the Court in the above-styled cause concludes these alerts occurred, at the latest, by 1:51:00.
