Although a Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer's inquiry may be wide-ranging, once all relevant computer checks run by Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer have come back clean, there is no more reasonable suspicion, and, as a general matter, continued questioning conducted by Gary Haston thereafter unconstitutionally prolongs the detention during traffic stop. ; see also ; . A recognized exception to this rule is that if additional reasonable suspicion, such as suspicions of drug trafficking, arises in the course of the traffic stop on Interstate 35 and before the initial purpose of the traffic stop, namely the traffic violation, has been fulfilled, then the detention during traffic stop may continue until the new reasonable suspicion has been dispelled or confirmed.
