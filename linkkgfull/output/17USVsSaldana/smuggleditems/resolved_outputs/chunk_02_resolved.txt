On November 24, 2014, Williamson County Sheriff's Office detectives Gary Haston and Heather Vargas were traveling northbound on Interstate 35. Gary Haston, a veteran narcotics investigator with 17 years of experience and who has participated in hundreds of drug interdiction cases, was teaching Heather Vargas, a relative newcomer to the narcotics division, drug interdiction techniques. At some point, their attention was drawn to the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck transporting a scissor lift. In particular, Gary Haston noticed the license plates for both the truck and the trailer were newly registered. A records check showed the trailer's license plate had been issued in Laredo four days earlier on November 20, 2014, and the registered owner was "Daniel Martin Huerta." The 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana's license plate had been registered in San Antonio on July 31, 2014, and its registered owner was "Daniel A. Huerta."
