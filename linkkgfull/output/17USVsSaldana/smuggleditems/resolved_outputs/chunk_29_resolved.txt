Taking all six of the factors into consideration, the Court in the above-styled cause concludes the consent was voluntary and valid, and Federico Saldana never revoked his consent even as Deputy Jason Cox's patrol video recording and Gary Haston increased the intrusiveness of the search. Therefore, the detention during traffic stop does not apply to the events occurring after Federico Saldana's voluntary consent.

Conclusion

Deputy Jason Cox's patrol video recording had reasonable suspicion Federico Saldana had committed a traffic violation when he initiated the traffic stop on Interstate 35. Within fifteen minutes—and before Deputy Jason Cox's patrol video recording had completed the initial purpose of the traffic stop by issuing the warning citation—Federico Saldana had voluntarily consented to a search of the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck. Moreover, Deputy Jason Cox's patrol video recording and Gary Haston developed additional reasonable suspicion of potential suspicions of drug trafficking through their observations and conversations with Federico Saldana, and they had yet to dispel or confirm these suspicions as of the time Federico Saldana gave his valid consent. As such, the Williamson County Sheriff's Office officers were justified in prolonging the traffic stop during those initial fifteen minutes and through the moment of consent. Federico Saldana never revoked his consent, and Deputy Jason Cox's patrol video recording and Gary Haston ultimately discovered the specific type of smuggled substance. Federico Saldana's rights were not violated, and therefore his motion to suppress, Federico Saldana's motion to suppress, the smuggled substances and his statements to law enforcement after the discovery of the smuggled substances must be denied.
