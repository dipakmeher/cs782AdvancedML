I.  First Prong of the Terry Test: Reasonable suspicion existed for the traffic stop

Federico Saldana  first disputes the basis for the traffic stop, relying on the fact  Federico Saldana did not commit any traffic violations in the presence of  Williamson County Sheriff's Office who pulled him over. "For a traffic stop to be  justified at its inception, an officer must have an objectively  reasonable suspicion that some sort of illegal activity, such as a  traffic violation, occurred, or is about to occur, before stopping  the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana." .  The Court in the above-styled cause has stated that in making a reasonable suspicion  inquiry, a court "must look at the totality of the  circumstances of each case to see whether the detaining officer has  a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal  wrongdoing." (internal quotations omitted). Reasonable suspicion can vest through  the collective knowledge of the officers in a search and seizure  operation. ,  .  The collective knowledge theory for reasonable suspicion applies so  long as there is    "some degree of communication" between the acting officer  and the officer who has knowledge of the necessary facts, utilizing the computer checks run by Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer.
