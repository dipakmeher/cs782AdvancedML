After more questions, Deputy Jason Cox and Gary Haston had Federico Saldana drive the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck a few hundred yards to a rest area where it would be safer to conduct the search. Id. at 13:30:01-32:15. Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer continued searching the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck themselves as they awaited the K-9 dog used for searching, which arrived roughly ten minutes later. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 2 at 13:41:25. The K-9 handler, Josiah Bennett, testified he understood from Williamson County Sheriff's Office officer that Federico Saldana had given consent to search, and he therefore proceeded to have the K-9 dog used for searching search the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck and the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana. Josiah Bennett next had the K-9 dog used for searching enter the cab of the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana through the front and rear doors on the driver side from approximately 1:45:55 to 1:46:45. Id. at 13:45:55-46:45. Josiah Bennett took the K-9 dog used for searching back to the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck and the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana again before taking the K-9 dog used for searching to the passenger side of the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana. While the view is mostly obstructed, Josiah Bennett seemed to have the K-9 dog used for searching enter the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana through the front and rear doors on the passenger side from approximately 1:49:55 to 1:51:00. Id. at 13:49:55-51:00. Josiah Bennett then put the K-9 dog used for searching back in his patrol car, which is part of the Williamson County Sheriff's Office.
