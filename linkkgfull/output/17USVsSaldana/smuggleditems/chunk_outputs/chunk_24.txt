The United States argues Federico Saldana gave his consent to Williamson County Sheriff's Office to search the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck, and he never revoked that consent at any time. Therefore, according to the United States, none of the events after the moment of consent implicate the. "To be valid, consent to search must be free and voluntary." . The United States has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the consent was voluntary. . The voluntariness of consent is "a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances." . The appropriate inquiry in determining the voluntariness of a consent is whether a reasonable person in Federico Saldana's position would have felt free to decline Williamson County Sheriff's Office's request. . In evaluating the voluntariness of consent, Court consider six factors:

(1) the voluntariness of Federico Saldana's custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive law enforcement procedures; (3) the extent and level of Federico Saldana's cooperation with the police; (4) Federico Saldana's awareness of his right to refuse to consent; (5) Federico Saldana's education and intelligence; and (6) Federico Saldana's belief that no incriminating evidence will be found.
