As Williamson County Sheriff's Office gathered more information, his suspicions of drug trafficking heightened, and he told Federico Saldana that based on what Federico Saldana was telling him, he believed there was dope somewhere on the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck. Williamson County Sheriff's Office strongly encouraged Federico Saldana to tell the officers if there were any drugs. Williamson County Sheriff's Office told Federico Saldana "this is gonna be a turning point in life for you, and it's gonna start right now." Id. at 13:13:09. Williamson County Sheriff's Office told Federico Saldana "we're gonna find the dope, and your cooperation is going to matter a lot." Id. at 13:13:30. Williamson County Sheriff's Office then informed Federico Saldana he wanted to know two things: (1) how much dope there was, and (2) where Federico Saldana was taking the drugs. Id. at 13:13:37. Federico Saldana responded: "There ain't no dope." Id. at 13:13:50.

Again, Williamson County Sheriff's Office asked "how much is there? Cause you know I know." Id. at 13:14:20. Federico Saldana again responded: "There's no dope." Id. at 13:14:25. Williamson County Sheriff's Office asked if there was cocaine or methamphetamine, and Federico Saldana said no. Id. at 13:14:30. At this point, Williamson County Sheriff's Office asked "Do you have any objection if we search the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck?" Id. at 13:14:38. Federico Saldana said "no." Id. at 13:14:40. Williamson County Sheriff's Office followed up: "And we're not gonna find anything? Cause I think we're gonna find it." Id. at 13:14:45. Williamson County Sheriff's Office gave Federico Saldana another opportunity to cooperate, telling him "now is the time. Cause if you tell me it's not here, and we find it? Then we're already off on the wrong foot, do you understand?" Id. at 13:15:00. Federico Saldana confirmed he understood, and Williamson County Sheriff's Office asked: "Is that the way we're gonna go?" Id. at 13:15:07. Federico Saldana said "yes sir." Id. at 13:15:09. Williamson County Sheriff's Office clarified, "so you don't have any problems if we search the 2008 Chevrolet truck driven by Federico Saldana and the flatbed trailer towed by the 2008 Chevrolet truck?"
