E nd  of Document
1  The  record is not entirely clear whether Gary Haston, an officer with the Williamson County Sheriff's Office, made the observations  described in this paragraph before or after the traffic stop.
2  The  United States submitted as Exhibit 1 Deputy Jason Cox, an officer with the Williamson County Sheriff's Office, 's patrol video recording in the  form of a DVD containing Deputy Jason Cox's patrol video recording containing three separate but consecutive clips of the  events in question. The DVD containing Deputy Jason Cox's patrol video references time on a 24-hour clock. For  citations, Court uses the 24-hour notation. When describing the  timing    of events, however, Court will use the 12-hour clock notation.
3  The  United States contends Federico Saldana initially offered the name "Miguel"  as the owner before later admitting the owner's true name is  "Daniel Martin Huerta." After carefully listening to the audio from Deputy Jason Cox's patrol video, Court concludes, at a minimum, Federico Saldana did not say "Miguel."  Court further concludes that Federico Saldana likely said the name  "Daniel Martin Huerta."
4  provides that "an operator on a roadway divided into two or  more clearly marked lanes for traffic: (1) shall drive as nearly as  practical entirely within a single lane; and (2) may not move from  the lane unless that movement can be made safely."
