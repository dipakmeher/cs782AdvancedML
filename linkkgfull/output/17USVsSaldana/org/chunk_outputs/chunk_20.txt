Therefore, according to the Government, none of the events after the moment of consent implicate the. "To be valid, consent to search must be free and voluntary." . The government has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the consent was voluntary. . The voluntariness of consent is "a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances." . The appropriate inquiry in determining the voluntariness of a consent is whether a reasonable person in Federico Saldana's position would have felt free to decline Gary Haston's request. . In evaluating the voluntariness of consent, Court consider six factors:

(1) the voluntariness of Federico Saldana's custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police procedures; (3) the extent and level of Federico Saldana's cooperation with the police; (4) Federico Saldana's awareness of his right to refuse to consent; (5) Federico Saldana's education and intelligence; and (6) Federico Saldana's belief that no incriminating evidence will be found.
