According to Gary Haston, the 2008 Chevrolet truck was traveling at approximately 75 miles per hour, and it changed lanes multiple times in an unsafe manner. Gary Haston described the 2008 Chevrolet truck as both following vehicles at an unsafe distance in the lane it occupied, and changing lanes into tight spaces where the trailing car in the lane into which the 2008 Chevrolet truck had just moved had to brake to avoid running into the back of the flatbed trailer. Gary Haston referenced two near-collisions he witnessed. Based on these observations, Gary Haston and Heather Vargas contacted a patrol deputy in a marked unit to conduct a traffic stop.
