Although not apparent from the video, according to Josiah Bennett's testimony, the dog alerted twice to the presence of narcotics. The first alert was to a set of tools on the floorboard of the front seat on the passenger side of the 2008 Chevrolet truck. The second alert was to clothes on the floorboard of the back seat on the passenger side of the 2008 Chevrolet truck. Comparing this testimony to the video, the Court concludes these alerts occurred, at the latest, by 1:51:00.
