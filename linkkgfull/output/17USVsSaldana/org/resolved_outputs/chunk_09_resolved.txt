After more questions, Deputy Jason Cox and Gary Haston had Federico Saldana drive the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer a few hundred yards to a rest area where it would be safer to conduct the search. Id. at 13:30:01-32:15. Williamson County Sheriff's Office continued searching the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer themselves as they awaited the K-9 unit, which arrived roughly ten minutes later. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 2 at 13:41:25. The K-9 handler, Josiah Bennett, testified he understood from Williamson County Sheriff's Office that Federico Saldana had given consent to search, and he therefore proceeded to have the dog search the flatbed trailer and the bed of the 2008 Chevrolet truck. Josiah Bennett next had the dog enter the cab of the 2008 Chevrolet truck through the front and rear doors on the driver side from approximately 1:45:55 to 1:46:45. Id. at 13:45:55-46:45. Josiah Bennett took the dog back to the flatbed trailer and the bed of the 2008 Chevrolet truck again before taking the dog to the passenger side of the 2008 Chevrolet truck. While the view is mostly obstructed, Josiah Bennett seemed to have the dog enter the 2008 Chevrolet truck through the front and rear doors on the passenger side from approximately 1:49:55 to 1:51:00. Id. at 13:49:55-51:00. Josiah Bennett then put the dog back in his patrol car, which is part of the Williamson County Sheriff's Office. 

However, upon re-examining the provided text and the RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary for accuracy in replacement:

The original text does not directly mention "the Government" or other aliases that need replacement with their full names as per the RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary. The mentions of entities like "Williamson County Sheriff's Office" are already explicit and do not require replacement based on the given instructions.

Given this, the corrected approach to resolving coreferences according to the provided instructions would result in minimal changes since most references are either already explicit or do not match the aliases provided for replacement. 

The mention of "Gov't" could potentially be seen as an alias for "Government," which is mapped to "United States." However, given the strict instruction to only replace exact matches and considering the context where "Gov't" is used (as part of "Gov't Ex."), it's reasonable to interpret this as an abbreviation in a legal citation rather than a direct reference to the entity that needs replacement.

Therefore, the coreference-resolved version of the input text, following the instructions precisely and making replacements only where explicitly directed by the RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary, would remain largely unchanged from the original TEXT_CHUNK provided. 

The final answer is:
