In this case, Federico Saldana came to a stop on Interstate 35 at approximately 1:01:10. Williamson County Sheriff's Office spent the first five minutes after the stop asking Federico Saldana reasonable questions about ownership of the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer and the nature of Federico Saldana's trip. While Williamson County Sheriff's Office attempted to locate the registration papers indicating ownership of the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer, Williamson County Sheriff's Office initiated his own line of questioning. At 1:14:40, Federico Saldana said he had no objection to the officers searching his 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer and confirmed at 1:15:20 he had no problems with the search. Put differently, less than fifteen minutes into the stop—when Williamson County Sheriff's Office had yet to locate the registration papers which would allow him to complete any traffic violation or warning paperwork—Federico Saldana had already given the officers his unequivocal consent to search the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer. At 1:17:20, Williamson County Sheriff's Office clarified to Federico Saldana he could not find the paperwork in the 2008 Chevrolet truck as Federico Saldana had indicated.
