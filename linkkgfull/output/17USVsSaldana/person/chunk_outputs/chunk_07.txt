As  Haston gathered more information, his suspicions of drug trafficking  heightened, and he told Saldana that based on what Saldana was  telling him, he believed there was dope somewhere on the truck or  trailer. Haston strongly encouraged Saldana to tell the officers if  there were any drugs. Haston told Saldana "this is gonna be a  turning point in life for you, and it's gonna start right now." Id .  at 13:13:09. Haston told Saldana "we're gonna find the dope,  and your cooperation    is going to matter a lot." Id .  at 13:13:30. Haston then informed Saldana he wanted to know two  things: (1) how much dope there was, and (2) where Saldana was  taking the drugs. Id .  at 13:13:37. Saldana responded: "There ain't no dope." Id .  at 13:13:50. Haston noted Saldana was evincing signs of nervousness  and reiterated "it's going to be a lot less stressful for you  if you start cooperating from this point." Id .  at 13:14:09. Haston cautioned Saldana that "if there's a load  of dope, we're gonna find it." Id .  at 13:14:15. Again, Haston asked "how much is there? Cause you  know I know." Id .  at 13:14:20. Saldana again responded: "There's no dope." Id .  at 13:14:25. Haston asked if there was cocaine or methamphetamine,  and Saldana said no. Id .  at 13:14:30. At this point, Haston asked "Do you have any  objection if we search the truck or trailer?" Id .  at 13:14:38. Saldana said "no." Id .  at 13:14:40. Haston followed up: "And we're not gonna find  anything? Cause I think we're gonna find it." Id .  at 13:14:45. Haston gave Saldana another opportunity to cooperate,  telling him "now is the time. Cause if you tell me it's not  here, and we find it? Then we're already off on the wrong foot, do  you understand?"     Id .  at 13:15:00. Saldana confirmed he understood, and Haston asked: "Is  that the way we're gonna go?" Id .  at 13:15:07. Saldana said "yes sir." Id .  at 13:15:09. Haston clarified, "so you don't have any problems  if we search the truck?" Id .  at 13:15:17. Saldana immediately responded: "No problem." Id .  at 13:15:20.
