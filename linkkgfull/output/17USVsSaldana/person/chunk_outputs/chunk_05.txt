See Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 1 at 12:59. Cox testified that he could not recall whether Haston relayed his  drug suspicions at this time, but Cox assumed the stop related to  drugs because he was familiar with Haston's work as a narcotics  investigator. The trailer at one point momentarily veered onto the  shoulder before returning inside the lane. Id .  at 12:59:21. Cox initiated a traffic stop on the shoulder of the  highway, and the driver stepped out of the vehicle, meeting Cox to  the right of the truck away from traffic. Mat 13:01:10. The driver  identified himself as Federico Saldana. Saldana indicated he was a  truck driver by trade but was not used to driving this sort of truck  with a trailer attached.
