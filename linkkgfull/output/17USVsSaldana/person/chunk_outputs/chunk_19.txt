As  a narcotics investigator with 17 years of experience, including  hundreds of interdiction cases, Haston strongly suspected Saldana  was transporting a load of dope and started inquiring    into Saldana's criminal history. Haston learned Saldana had  previously smuggled  aliens and drugs using his 18-wheeler. Haston told Saldana that he  suspected Saldana was again transporting drugs. Haston urged Saldana  to cooperate and directly asked if he were moving drugs, which  Saldana denied. Haston responded by asking if Saldana objected to or  had any problem with the officers searching his truck and trailer,  and Saldana stated he had no objection and no problem. Taken  together, from the time Cox stopped Saldana for the traffic  violations to the point where Saldana gave his consent to search,  additional reasonable suspicion arose for Haston both through his  observations and conversations. Haston had yet to either dispel or  confirm these accumulating suspicions as of that time, and he could  validly prolong the detention in order to address these concerns.

III.  The Consent was Voluntary and Never Revoked
