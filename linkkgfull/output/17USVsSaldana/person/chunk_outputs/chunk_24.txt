Moving  on to the third factor, Saldana was quite cooperative as he answered  the officers' questions and caused them no problems. For the fourth  factor, there is no indication in the record Saldana was aware of  his right to refuse consent. Yet while officers are not required to  explicitly inform defendants of the right to refuse consent, the  wording of both of Haston' s questions regarding consent gave  Saldana a clear opportunity to either object to or state a problem  with a search. Moreover, Saldana is a previously convicted felon  experienced with the criminal justice system, including having  served at least 9 years in federal prison, which makes it more  likely he is aware of his legal rights. Regarding the fifth factor,  there    is no evidence in the record demonstrating Saldana's level of  education. His conversations and interactions with the officers do  suggest he is an individual of reasonable intelligence. Finally,  with respect to the sixth factor, Saldana did not testify, so it is  difficult to know what his belief was concerning whether any drugs  would be found. He did repeatedly deny there were any drugs. He also  was very quick to give his consent to search, suggesting he believed  the officers would not find any drugs.
