Ultimately,  Haston asked: "Do you have any objection if we search the truck  or trailer?" Saldana responded he did not. Forty seconds later,  Haston again confirmed: "So you don't have any problems if we  search the truck?" Saldana said he had no problem. While Haston  did not specifically tell Saldana he had a right to refuse his  search request, both of Haston's questions indicated Saldana could  either object to, or express a problem with, a search. See (finding it is "particularly worth noting" that the police  specifically advised the subject he had a right to refuse consent to  search his luggage). Saldana, with no hesitation or seeming concern,  gave the officers his consent to look for drugs in the truck and the  trailer. There is no indication in the record that Saldana ever  expressed concern or confusion over his consent. Instead, Saldana  remained cooperative throughout the process, including driving the  truck and trailer to the rest stop for the dog search and further  driving the truck and trailer to the tire shop for more thorough  searching. It cannot be said Saldana merely submitted to  overpowering authority. See (noting    orderly submission to law enforcement who falsely represented to  defendant they had authority to conduct search pursuant to a warrant  was not valid consent); (concluding that in circumstances involving a 17-year-old boy  awakened in his bedroom at 3:00 a.m. by police officers who told him  "we need to go and talk," his response of "okay"  was not regarded as consent but a "mere submission to  authority"). In sum, Saldana's consent was not the product of  coercion.
