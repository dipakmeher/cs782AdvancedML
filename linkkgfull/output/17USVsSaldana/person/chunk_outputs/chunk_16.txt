In  this case, Saldana came to a stop on the shoulder at approximately  1:01:10. Haston spent the first five minutes after the stop asking  Saldana reasonable questions about ownership of the truck and  trailer and the nature of Saldana's trip. While Cox attempted to  locate the registration papers indicating ownership of the truck and  trailer, Haston initiated his own line of questioning. At 1:14:40,  Saldana said he had no objection to the officers searching his truck  and trailer and confirmed at 1:15:20 he had no problems with the  search. Put differently, less than fifteen minutes into the  stop—when Cox had yet to locate the registration papers which  would allow him to complete any traffic violation or warning  paperwork—Saldana had already given the officers his unequivocal  consent to search the truck and trailer. At 1:17:20, Cox clarified  to Saldana he could not find the paperwork in the truck as Saldana  had indicated. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 1 at 13:17:20.
