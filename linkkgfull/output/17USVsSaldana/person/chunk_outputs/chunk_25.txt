Taking  all six of the factors into consideration, the Court concludes the  consent was voluntary and valid, and Saldana never revoked his  consent even as the officers increased the intrusiveness of the  search. Therefore, the does not apply to the events occurring after Saldana's voluntary  consent.

Conclusion

Cox  had reasonable suspicion Saldana had committed a traffic violation  when he initiated the stop. Within fifteen minutes—and before Cox  had completed the initial purpose of the stop by issuing the warning  citation—Saldana had voluntarily consented to a search of the  truck and trailer. Moreover, Cox and Haston developed additional  reasonable suspicion of potential drug trafficking through    their observations and conversations with Saldana, and they had yet  to dispel or confirm these suspicions as of the time Saldana gave  his valid consent. As such, the officers were justified in  prolonging the stop during those initial fifteen minutes and through  the moment of consent. Saldana never revoked his consent, and the  officers ultimately discovered the secreted cocaine. Saldana's rights were not violated, and therefore his motion to suppress the  drugs and his statements to law enforcement after the discovery of  the drugs must be denied.

Accordingly,  IT IS ORDERED that Defendant Federico Saldana's Motion to Suppress  #24 is DENIED.
