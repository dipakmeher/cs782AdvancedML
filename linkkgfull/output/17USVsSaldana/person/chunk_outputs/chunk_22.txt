As  for the second factor, there is minimal indication of coercive  police procedures. The stop began as a routine traffic encounter.  Cox and Saldana engaged in a cooperative, polite conversation  regarding Saldana's traffic violations, the ownership of the truck  and trailer, and the itinerary of Saldana's trip. Haston also asked  Saldana many questions, and Saldana was ready and willing to answer  all of them. Haston's manner certainly became more aggressive as his  suspicions grew, but his conduct did not amount to coercion. Haston  openly informed Saldana of his belief as to the presence of  narcotics, and Haston applied some pressure in attempting to elicit  Saldana's cooperation. For instance, Haston made the following  statements: "this is gonna be a turning point in life for you,  and it's gonna start right now"; "we're gonna find the  dope, and your cooperation is going to matter a lot"; "it's  going to be a lot less stressful for you if you start cooperating  from this point"; "if there's a load of dope, we're gonna  find it"; and "how much is there? Cause you know I know."  While Saldana showed signs of nervousness, he continued to answer  the    questions and persisted in denying the presence of any drugs.
