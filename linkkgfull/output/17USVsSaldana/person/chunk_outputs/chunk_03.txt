Haston  testified to a number of other observations he made. He noticed the scissor lift had received a new paint job and  observed the battery charger area had a new over-coating of paint. See Def. Ex. 2. Haston also observed the truck was outfitted with what  he considered over-sized tires and after-market rims, which he found  atypical for trucks pulling a heavy piece of machinery. See Def. Ex. 1. Haston also testified that in his experience  large,    after-market rims are often used to hide loads of narcotics. Haston  further noted two pieces of steel had been placed under the wheels  of the scissor lift, which Haston interpreted to mean the scissor  lift would be on the trailer for a long time—consistent, according  to Haston, with drug trafficking. See Def. Ex. 2.
