UNITED  STATES DISTRICT JUDGE

E nd  of Document

1  The  record is not entirely clear whether Haston made the observations  described in this paragraph before or after the traffic stop.

2  The  Government submitted as Exhibit 1 Deputy Cox's patrol video in the  form of a DVD containing three separate but consecutive clips of the  events in question. The DVD references time on a 24-hour clock. For  citations, the Court uses the 24-hour notation. When describing the  timing    of events, however, the Court will use the 12-hour clock notation.

3  The  Government contends Saldana initially offered the name "Miguel"  as the owner before later admitting the owner's true name is  "Daniel." After carefully listening to the audio, the  Court concludes, at a minimum, Saldana did not say "Miguel."  The Court further concludes that Saldana likely said the name  "Daniel."

4  provides that "an operator on a roadway divided into two or  more clearly marked lanes for traffic: (1) shall drive as nearly as  practical entirely within a single lane; and (2) may not move from  the lane unless that movement can be made safely." .
