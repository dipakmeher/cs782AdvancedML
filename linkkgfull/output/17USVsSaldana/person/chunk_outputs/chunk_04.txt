According  to Haston, the truck was traveling at approximately 75 miles per  hour, and it changed lanes multiple times in an unsafe manner.  Haston described the truck as both following vehicles at an unsafe  distance in the lane it occupied, and changing lanes into tight  spaces where the trailing car in the lane into which the truck had  just moved had to brake to avoid running into the back of the  trailer. Haston referenced two near-collisions he witnessed. Based  on these observations, Haston and Vargas contacted a patrol deputy  in a marked unit to conduct a traffic stop.
