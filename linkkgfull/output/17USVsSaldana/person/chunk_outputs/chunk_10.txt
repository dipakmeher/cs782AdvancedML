Although  not apparent from the video, according to Bennett's testimony, the  dog alerted twice to the presence of narcotics. The first alert was  to a set of tools on the floorboard of the front seat on the  passenger side. The second alert was to clothes on the floorboard of  the back seat on the passenger side. Comparing this testimony to the  video, the Court concludes these alerts occurred, at the latest, by  1:51:00.

After  Bennett put the dog away, the officers continued searching the truck  and trailer themselves looking for drugs. Bennett    used the dog again to search the trailer and the bed of the truck  before returning the dog to the patrol car. Id .  at 14:03:45-l 0:00. For approximately the next half hour, the  officers continued examining the truck and trailer. Their attention  increasingly focused on the scissor lift. Id .  at 14:37:00. The officers made arrangements to transport the truck  and trailer to a tire shop for further investigation. They informed  Saldana of the plan, and he began driving the truck and trailer  himself to the tire shop. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 3 at 14:46:35. The video  evidence ends with Saldana still driving over twenty minutes later.
