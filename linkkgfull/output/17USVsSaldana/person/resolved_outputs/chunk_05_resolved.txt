At approximately 12:59 p.m., Deputy Jason Cox, responding to the traffic violation information provided by Gary Haston and Heather Vargas, pulled up behind the truck traveling in the far right lane. See Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 1 at 12:59. Jason Cox testified that he could not recall whether Gary Haston relayed his drug suspicions at this time, but Jason Cox assumed the stop related to drugs because he was familiar with Gary Haston's work as a narcotics investigator. The trailer at one point momentarily veered onto the shoulder before returning inside the lane. Id. at 12:59:21. Jason Cox initiated a traffic stop on the shoulder of the highway, and the driver stepped out of the vehicle, meeting Jason Cox to the right of the truck away from traffic. At 13:01:10. The driver identified himself as Federico Saldana. Federico Saldana indicated he was a truck driver by trade but was not used to driving this sort of truck with a trailer attached. When asked who the owner of the truck and trailer were, Federico Saldana was not able to easily recall the owner's name but did indicate—although the audio is not entirely clear—the owner's first name was "Daniel." Id. at 13:02:07.
