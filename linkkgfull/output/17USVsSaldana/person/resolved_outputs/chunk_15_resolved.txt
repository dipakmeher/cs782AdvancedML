Saldana also contends the officers' prolonged detention of him exceeded the scope of the reason for the traffic stop. Generally, the "detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop . . . ." In the course of effectuating the stop, a police officer may permissibly examine the driver's license and registration and run a computer check on them to investigate whether the driver has any outstanding warrants and if the vehicle is stolen. An officer may also ask the driver about the purpose and itinerary of his trip. Indeed, the officer's questions need not even be related to the purpose of the traffic stop, since "detention, not questioning, is the evil at which Terry's second prong is aimed." 

Although an officer's inquiry may be wide-ranging, once all relevant computer checks have come back clean, there is no more reasonable suspicion, and, as a general matter, continued questioning thereafter unconstitutionally prolongs the detention. ; see also ; . A recognized exception to this rule is that if additional reasonable suspicion arises in the course of the stop and before the initial purpose of the stop has been fulfilled, then the detention may continue until the new reasonable suspicion has been dispelled or confirmed.
