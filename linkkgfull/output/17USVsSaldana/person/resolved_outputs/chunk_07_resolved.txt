As Gary Haston gathered more information, his suspicions of drug trafficking heightened, and he told Federico Saldana that based on what Federico Saldana was telling him, he believed there was dope somewhere on the truck or trailer. Gary Haston strongly encouraged Federico Saldana to tell the officers if there were any drugs. Gary Haston told Federico Saldana "this is gonna be a turning point in life for you, and it's gonna start right now." Id. at 13:13:09. Gary Haston told Federico Saldana "we're gonna find the dope, and your cooperation is going to matter a lot." Id. at 13:13:30. Gary Haston then informed Federico Saldana he wanted to know two things: (1) how much dope there was, and (2) where Federico Saldana was taking the drugs. Id. at 13:13:37. Federico Saldana responded: "There ain't no dope." Id. at 13:13:50. Gary Haston noted Federico Saldana was evincing signs of nervousness and reiterated "it's going to be a lot less stressful for you if you start cooperating from this point." Id. at 13:14:09. Gary Haston cautioned Federico Saldana that "if there's a load of dope, we're gonna find it." Id. at 13:14:15. Again, Gary Haston asked "how much is there? Cause you know I know." Id. at 13:14:20. Federico Saldana again responded: "There's no dope." Id. at 13:14:25. Gary Haston asked if there was cocaine or methamphetamine, and Federico Saldana said no. Id. at 13:14:30. At this point, Gary Haston asked "Do you have any objection if we search the truck or trailer?" Id. at 13:14:38. Federico Saldana said "no." Id. at 13:14:40. Gary Haston followed up: "And we're not gonna find anything? Cause I think we're gonna find it." Id. at 13:14:45. Gary Haston gave Federico Saldana another opportunity to cooperate, telling him "now is the time. Cause if you tell me it's not here, and we find it? Then we're already off on the wrong foot, do you understand?" Id. at 13:15:00. Federico Saldana confirmed he understood, and Gary Haston asked: "Is that the way we're gonna go?" Id. at 13:15:07. Federico Saldana said "yes sir." Id. at 13:15:09. Gary Haston clarified, "so you don't have any problems if we search the truck?" Id. at 13:15:17. Federico Saldana immediately responded: "No problem." Id. at 13:15:20.
