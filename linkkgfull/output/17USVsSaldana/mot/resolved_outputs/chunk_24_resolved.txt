Moving on to the third factor, Federico Saldana was quite cooperative as he answered Jason Cox and Gary Haston's questions and caused them no problems. For the fourth factor, there is no indication in the record Federico Saldana was aware of his right to refuse consent. Yet while officers are not required to explicitly inform defendants of the right to refuse consent, the wording of both of Gary Haston's questions regarding consent gave Federico Saldana a clear opportunity to either object to or state a problem with a search. Moreover, Federico Saldana is a previously convicted felon experienced with the criminal justice system, including having served at least 9 years in federal prison, which makes it more likely he is aware of his legal rights. Regarding the fifth factor, there is no evidence in the record demonstrating Federico Saldana's level of education. His conversations and interactions with Jason Cox and Gary Haston do suggest he is an individual of reasonable intelligence. Finally, with respect to the sixth factor, Federico Saldana did not testify, so it is difficult to know what his belief was concerning whether any drugs would be found. He did repeatedly deny there were any drugs. He also was very quick to give his consent to search, suggesting he believed Jason Cox and Gary Haston would not find any drugs.
