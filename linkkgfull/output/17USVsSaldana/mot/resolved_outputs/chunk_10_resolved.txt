Although not apparent from the video, according to Josiah Bennett's testimony, the dog alerted twice to the presence of narcotics. The first alert was to a set of tools on the floorboard of the front seat on the passenger side of the 2008 Chevrolet truck. The second alert was to clothes on the floorboard of the back seat on the passenger side of the 2008 Chevrolet truck. Comparing this testimony to the video, the Court concludes these alerts occurred, at the latest, by 1:51:00.

After Josiah Bennett put the dog away, Jason Cox and Gary Haston continued searching the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer themselves looking for drugs. Josiah Bennett used the dog again to search the flatbed trailer and the bed of the 2008 Chevrolet truck before returning the dog to the patrol car. Id. at 14:03:45-10:00. For approximately the next half hour, Jason Cox and Gary Haston continued examining the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer. Their attention increasingly focused on the scissor lift. Id. at 14:37:00. The officers made arrangements to transport the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer to a tire shop for further investigation. They informed Federico Saldana of the plan, and he began driving the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer himself to the tire shop. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 3 at 14:46:35. The video evidence ends with Federico Saldana still driving over twenty minutes later.
