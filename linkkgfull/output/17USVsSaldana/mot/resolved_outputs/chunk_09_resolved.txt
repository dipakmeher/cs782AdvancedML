After more questions, Jason Cox and Gary Haston had Federico Saldana drive the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer a few hundred yards to a rest area where it would be safer to conduct the search. Id. at 13:30:01-32:15. Jason Cox and Gary Haston continued searching the 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer themselves as they awaited the K-9 unit, which arrived roughly ten minutes later. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 2 at 13:41:25. The K-9 handler, Josiah Bennett, testified he understood from Jason Cox and Gary Haston that Federico Saldana had given consent to search, and he therefore proceeded to have the dog search the flatbed trailer and the bed of the 2008 Chevrolet truck. Josiah Bennett next had the dog enter the cab of the 2008 Chevrolet truck through the front and rear doors on the driver side from approximately 1:45:55 to 1:46:45. Id. at 13:45:55-46:45. Josiah Bennett took the dog back to the flatbed trailer and the bed of the 2008 Chevrolet truck again before taking the dog to the passenger side of the 2008 Chevrolet truck. While the view is mostly obstructed, Josiah Bennett seemed to have the dog enter the 2008 Chevrolet truck through the front and rear doors on the passenger side from approximately 1:49:55 to 1:51:00. Id. at 13:49:55-51:00. Josiah Bennett then put the dog back in his patrol car.
