As a narcotics investigator with 17 years of experience, including hundreds of interdiction cases, Gary Haston strongly suspected Federico Saldana was transporting a load of dope and started inquiring into Federico Saldana's criminal history. Gary Haston learned Federico Saldana had previously smuggled aliens and drugs using his 18-wheeler. Gary Haston told Federico Saldana that he suspected Federico Saldana was again transporting drugs. Gary Haston urged Federico Saldana to cooperate and directly asked if he were moving drugs, which Federico Saldana denied. Gary Haston responded by asking if Federico Saldana objected to or had any problem with the officers searching his 2008 Chevrolet truck and flatbed trailer, and Federico Saldana stated he had no objection and no problem. Taken together, from the time Jason Cox stopped Federico Saldana for the traffic violations to the point where Federico Saldana gave his consent to search, additional reasonable suspicion arose for Gary Haston both through his observations and conversations. Gary Haston had yet to either dispel or confirm these accumulating suspicions as of that time, and he could validly prolong the detention in order to address these concerns.

III. The Consent was Voluntary and Never Revoked
