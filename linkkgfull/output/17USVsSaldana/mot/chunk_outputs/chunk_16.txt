In this case, Federico Saldana came to a stop on Interstate 35 at approximately 1:01:10. Gary Haston spent the first five minutes after the stop asking Federico Saldana reasonable questions about ownership of the truck and trailer and the nature of Federico Saldana's trip. While Jason Cox attempted to locate the registration papers indicating ownership of the truck and trailer, Gary Haston initiated his own line of questioning. At 1:14:40, Federico Saldana said he had no objection to the officers searching his truck and trailer and confirmed at 1:15:20 he had no problems with the search. Put differently, less than fifteen minutes into the stop—when Jason Cox had yet to locate the registration papers which would allow him to complete any traffic violation or warning paperwork—Federico Saldana had already given the officers his unequivocal consent to search the truck and trailer. At 1:17:20, Jason Cox clarified to Federico Saldana he could not find the paperwork in the truck as Federico Saldana had indicated. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 1 at 13:17:20.
