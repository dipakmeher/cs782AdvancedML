Abdullah Yusuf waived his Miranda rights. He then told Homeland Security Inspector Juan Carlos De Arcos that he was headed to Dallas and didn't know what he was hauling. Abdullah Yusuf claimed a brokerage company named "You Brokerage" paid him $2,700 to haul the load. He said he arrived at the Auburn Road lot—the Auburn Road lot in Laredo, Texas—between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. On his telling, Abdullah Yusuf then backed flatbed trailer to the area, took his tractor to the Flying J to wait while the flatbed trailer carrying 84 illegal aliens was being loaded, returned an hour later, hooked his tractor to the now-loaded flatbed trailer carrying 84 illegal aliens, received a bill of lading ("BOL"), and started for Dallas.

Juan Carlos De Arcos testified that Jamco International, Inc. owned the Auburn Road lot and used it for storing empty trailers. The Auburn Road lot had a "loose gravel" surface. The Auburn Road lot had no warehouse, loading equipment, or loading dock. A representative from Jamco testified that the Auburn Road lot only had one entrance, locked daily from 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m.
