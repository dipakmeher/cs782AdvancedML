Abdullah Yusuf was stopped by United States Border Patrol near Laredo, Texas, while smuggling 84 illegal aliens in the flatbed trailer used for smuggling 84 illegal aliens carrying 84 illegal aliens.

I.

On March 19, 2021, Abdullah Yusuf pulled the flatbed trailer used for smuggling 84 illegal aliens north on Interstate 35. At the United States Border Patrol checkpoint near Laredo, Texas, a police dog alerted to the flatbed trailer used for smuggling 84 illegal aliens. Further inspection revealed that the flatbed trailer used for smuggling 84 illegal aliens carrying 84 illegal aliens carried 84 illegal aliens inside several wooden crates arranged in a rectangle and covered by a tarp. The Government charged Abdullah Yusuf with transporting illegal aliens within the United States for financial gain and conspiring to do the same.
