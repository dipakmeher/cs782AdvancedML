On March 19, 2021, Abdullah Yusuf pulled a flatbed trailer north on Interstate 35. At a United States Border Patrol checkpoint near Laredo, Texas, a police dog alerted to flatbed trailer. Further inspection revealed that the flatbed trailer carrying 84 illegal aliens carried 84 illegal aliens inside several wooden crates arranged in a rectangle and covered by a tarp.
