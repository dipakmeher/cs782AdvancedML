Agent Juan Carlos De Arcos also testified that his investigation into "You Brokerage" revealed no record of the company's existence. The phone number Abdullah Yusuf provided for "You Brokerage" didn't work. Agent Juan Carlos De Arcos could not find a logbook in the flatbed trailer used for smuggling. He did, however, find the BOL for the load in question. It identified United States Trucking—not Abdullah Yusuf's company, Steel on Steel Transportation—as the carrier, contained a trailer number that didn't match the flatbed trailer used for smuggling, included an origin address other than the Auburn Road lot, and listed a delivery address in North Carolina, not Dallas. Agent Juan Carlos De Arcos testified that the BOL appeared to have been forged by doctoring an older one, also found in the flatbed trailer used for smuggling.
