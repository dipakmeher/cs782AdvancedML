Abdullah Yusuf is a defendant.

Andrew S. Oldham, Circuit Judge:

Abdullah Yusuf was stopped by Border Patrol near Laredo, Texas, while smuggling 84 illegal aliens in a trailer. A jury convicted him for trafficking aliens. On appeal, Abdullah Yusuf argues the jury had insufficient evidence. We disagree and affirm.

I.

On March 19, 2021, Abdullah Yusuf pulled a flatbed trailer north on Interstate 35. At a Border Patrol checkpoint near Laredo, Texas, a police dog alerted to Abdullah Yusuf's vehicle. Further inspection revealed that the trailer carried 84 illegal aliens inside several wooden crates arranged in a rectangle and covered by a tarp. The Government charged Abdullah Yusuf with transporting illegal aliens within the United States for financial gain and conspiring to do the same.

Abdullah Yusuf waived his Miranda rights. He then told Homeland Security Inspector Juan Carlos De Arcos that he was headed to Dallas and didn't know what he was hauling. Abdullah Yusuf claimed a brokerage company named "You Brokerage" paid him $2,700 to haul the load. He said he arrived at the pickup location—a lot on Auburn Road in Laredo—between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. On his telling, Abdullah Yusuf then backed his trailer to the loading dock, took his tractor to the Flying J to wait while the trailer was being loaded, returned an hour later, hooked his tractor to the now-loaded trailer, received a bill of lading ("BOL"), and started for Dallas.

Juan Carlos De Arcos testified that Jamco International, Inc. owned the Auburn Road lot and used it for storing empty trailers. The lot had a "loose gravel" surface. The lot had no warehouse, loading equipment, or loading dock. A representative from Jamco testified that the lot only had one entrance, locked daily from 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m.

Agent Juan Carlos De Arcos also testified that his investigation into "You Brokerage" revealed no record of the company's existence. The phone number Abdullah Yusuf provided for "You Brokerage" didn't work. Agent Juan Carlos De Arcos could not find a logbook in Abdullah Yusuf's tractor. He did, however, find the BOL for the load in question. It identified USA Trucking—not Abdullah Yusuf's company, Steel on Steel Transportation—as the carrier, contained a trailer number that didn't match Abdullah Yusuf's trailer, included an origin address other than Auburn Road, and listed a delivery address in North Carolina, not Dallas. Agent Juan Carlos De Arcos testified that the BOL appeared to have been forged by doctoring an older one, also found in the tractor.
