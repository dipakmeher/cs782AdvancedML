Yusuf  waived his Miranda rights. He then    told Homeland Security Inspector Juan Carlos De Arcos that he was  headed to Dallas and didn't know what he was hauling. Yusuf claimed  a brokerage company named "You Brokerage" paid him $2,700  to haul the load. He said he arrived at the pickup location—a lot  on Auburn Road in Laredo—between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. On his  telling, Yusuf then backed his trailer to the loading dock, took his  tractor to the Flying J to wait while the trailer was being loaded,  returned an hour later, hooked his tractor to the now-loaded  trailer, received a bill of lading ("BOL"), and started  for Dallas.

Agent  De Arcos testified that Jamco International, Inc. owned the Auburn  Road lot and used it for storing empty trailers. The lot had a  "loose gravel" surface. The lot had no warehouse, loading  equipment, or loading dock. A representative from Jamco testified  that the lot only had one entrance, locked daily from 9:00 p.m. to  9:00 a.m.
