Agent  De Arcos also testified that his investigation into "You  Brokerage" revealed no record of the company's existence. The  phone number Yusuf provided for "You Brokerage" didn't  work. Agent De Arcos could not find a logbook in Yusuf's tractor. He  did, however, find the BOL    for the load in question. It identified USA Trucking—not Yusuf's  company, Steel on Steel Transportation—as the carrier, contained a  trailer number that didn't match Yusuf's trailer, included an origin  address other than Auburn Road, and listed a delivery address in  North Carolina, not Dallas. Agent De Arcos testified that the BOL  appeared to have been forged by doctoring an older one, also found  in the tractor.
