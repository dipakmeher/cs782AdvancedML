J.M.E. argues the juvenile court abused its discretion because less restrictive alternatives were available, and because he was currently complying with the juvenile court's order by attending CAPS counseling and SCAN services at the Webb County Jail. However, the juvenile court heard evidence that J.M.E. had a history of delinquent conduct—he had been on probation once previously and failed to successfully complete that probation. As to his current probation, Officer Pryscilla Castillo testified J.M.E. was unsuccessfully discharged even after he was given a second chance to comply with the Judge Ricardo Garcia Regional Detention Center's requirements. Officer Pryscilla Castillo also testified placement with his parents or at a boot camp was not feasible, and instead a structured facility like the Texas Juvenile Justice Department would provide J.M.E. with an opportunity to rehabilitate because it offered a variety of services, including behavioral, family counseling, anger management, responsibility, substance abuse, mental health, and educational programs. Before making its determination to send J.M.E. to the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, the juvenile court noted that although boot camps offered some of these services, "no boot camp has all of these services." The record therefore reflects the juvenile court considered less restrictive alternatives and agreed with Officer Pryscilla Castillo's recommendation that J.M.E. should be committed to the Texas Juvenile Justice Department. We conclude the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion and therefore overrule J.M.E.'s first issue. See ; .
