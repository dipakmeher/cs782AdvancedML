When a juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent, the Juvenile Court may modify its disposition to commit the juvenile to a Texas Juvenile Justice Department facility if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the juvenile violated a reasonable and lawful condition of probation. A plea of true to a violation of probation is "analogous to a judicial confession that justifies the court's finding the violation was committed by a preponderance of the evidence." (mem. op.) (quoting). A trial court is not required to exhaust all possible alternatives before sending a juvenile to the Texas Juvenile Justice Department.; (mem. op.).

Application

As a condition of probation, J.M.E. was ordered to complete "Counseling and Psychological Services and SCAN Services, Southwest Keys Program after completion of Intensive Supervision Probation, Cognitive Life Skills Program at Youth Village." J.M.E. pled true to violating this condition of his probation. Based on J.M.E.'s plea of true, the Juvenile Court was justified in modifying the disposition from probation to confinement in a Texas Juvenile Justice Department facility. See.
