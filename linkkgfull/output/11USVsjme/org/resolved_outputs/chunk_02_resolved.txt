On May 30, 2018, J.M.E. was unsuccessfully discharged from the Judge Ricardo Garcia Regional Detention Center because J.M.E. failed to comply with its requirements. J.M.E. was detained at the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, but was later transferred to the Webb County Jail after assaulting another juvenile. Since J.M.E.'s transfer, J.M.E. has not been released. On January 12, 2019, the State filed a motion to modify disposition, alleging J.M.E. violated the conditions of J.M.E.'s probation because J.M.E. was unsuccessfully discharged from the Judge Ricardo Garcia Regional Detention Center and failed to complete any of the court-ordered services.
