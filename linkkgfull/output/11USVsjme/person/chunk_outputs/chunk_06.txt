J.M.E.  argues the juvenile court abused its discretion because less  restrictive alternatives were available, and because he was  currently complying with the juvenile court's order by attending  CAPS counseling and SCAN services at the Webb    County Jail. However, the juvenile court heard evidence that J.M.E.  had a history of delinquent conduct—he had been on probation once  previously and failed to successfully complete that probation. As to  his current probation, Officer Castillo testified J.M.E. was  unsuccessfully discharged even after he was given a second chance to  comply with the Center's requirements. Officer Castillo also  testified placement with his parents or at a boot camp was not  feasible, and instead a structured facility like the TJJD would  provide J.M.E. with an opportunity to rehabilitate because it  offered a variety of services, including behavioral, family  counseling, anger management, responsibility, substance abuse,  mental health, and educational programs. Before making its  determination to send J.M.E. to the TJJD, the juvenile court noted  that although boot camps offered some of these services, "no  boot camp has all of these services." The record therefore  reflects the juvenile court considered less restrictive alternatives  and agreed with Officer Castillo's recommendation that J.M.E. should  be committed to the TJJD. We conclude the juvenile court did not  abuse its discretion and therefore overrule J.M.E.'s    first issue. See ; .
