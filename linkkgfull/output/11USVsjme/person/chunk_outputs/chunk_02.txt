On  May 30, 2018, J.M.E. was unsuccessfully discharged from the Center  because he failed to comply with its requirements. He was detained  at the TJJD, but was later transferred to the Webb County Jail after  assaulting another juvenile. Since his transfer, he has not been  released. On January 12, 2019, the State filed a motion to modify  disposition, alleging J.M.E. violated the conditions of his  probation because he was unsuccessfully discharged from the Center  and failed to complete any of the court-ordered services.

At  the hearing on the State's motion to modify, J.M.E. pled true to  being unsuccessfully discharged from the Center and failing to  complete any of the court-ordered services. The juvenile court also  heard testimony from J.M.E.'s probation officer, Officer Pryscilla  Castillo, who testified J.M.E. was unsuccessfully discharged from  the Center because he did not participate in counseling sessions and  initiated    fights with other juveniles at the Center. She further testified  that J.M.E. could not be placed with his parents after his  unsuccessful discharge because they did not provide adequate  supervision.
