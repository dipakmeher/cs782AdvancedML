On May 30, 2018, J.M.E. was unsuccessfully discharged from the Center because J.M.E. failed to comply with its requirements. J.M.E. was detained at the TJJD, but was later transferred to the Webb County Jail after assaulting another juvenile. Since J.M.E.'s transfer, J.M.E. has not been released. On January 12, 2019, the State filed a motion to modify disposition, alleging J.M.E. violated the conditions of J.M.E.'s probation because J.M.E. was unsuccessfully discharged from the Center and failed to complete any of the court-ordered services.

At the hearing on the State's motion to modify, J.M.E. pled true to being unsuccessfully discharged from the Center and failing to complete any of the court-ordered services. The juvenile court also heard testimony from J.M.E.'s probation officer, Officer Pryscilla Castillo, who testified J.M.E. was unsuccessfully discharged from the Center because J.M.E. did not participate in counseling sessions and initiated fights with other juveniles at the Center. Officer Pryscilla Castillo further testified that J.M.E. could not be placed with J.M.E.'s parents after J.M.E.'s unsuccessful discharge because they did not provide adequate supervision.
