J.M.E. also argues the Juvenile Court violated his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment because his modified disposition is grossly disproportionate to the offense for which he was placed on probation. However, J.M.E. did not preserve this complaint for appellate review.

To preserve a complaint for appellate review, a defendant must present the trial court with a timely request, objection, or motion stating the specific grounds for the ruling desired. This preservation rule applies to a complaint that a sentence is grossly disproportionate and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. (holding complaint of cruel and unusual punishment under Texas Constitution was waived because defendant failed to object in trial court).

Here, J.M.E. did not raise his complaint about the constitutionality of his disposition in the Juvenile Court when that court modified his disposition or in a motion for new trial. By failing to make an objection in the Juvenile Court, J.M.E. forfeited his complaint on appeal. See ; see also ; (mem. op.) (holding appellant forfeited his complaint that trial court violated his rights when it ordered him committed to Texas Juvenile Justice Department by failing to present it to the trial court). We therefore overrule J.M.E.'s final issue.

Conclusion

Having overruled each of J.M.E.'s issues, we affirm the Juvenile Court's order committing J.M.E. to the Texas Juvenile Justice Department.

Beth Watkins, Justice
