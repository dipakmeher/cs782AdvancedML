At the hearing on the State's motion to modify, J.M.E. pled true to being unsuccessfully discharged from the Judge Ricardo Garcia Regional Detention Center and failing to complete any of the court-ordered services. The Juvenile Court also heard testimony from J.M.E.'s probation officer, Officer Pryscilla Castillo, who testified J.M.E. was unsuccessfully discharged from the Judge Ricardo Garcia Regional Detention Center because J.M.E. did not participate in counseling sessions and initiated fights with other juveniles at the Judge Ricardo Garcia Regional Detention Center. Officer Pryscilla Castillo further testified that J.M.E. could not be placed with J.M.E.'s parents after J.M.E.'s unsuccessful discharge because they did not provide adequate supervision.
