Nevertheless, "it is well established that a road's reputation as a smuggling route adds to the reasonableness of the agents' suspicion." (emphasis added) (quotation and citation omitted). This factor weighs in favor of reasonable suspicion.

Usual traffic patterns

Andrew P. Graham testified that traffic is typically very light coming out of Big Bend National Park before six o'clock in the morning and that he was surprised to see a work truck leaving Big Bend National Park so early on a Sunday morning. The district court thus considered the truck's presence on Texas Highway 385 at that time to be a deviation from the typical traffic patterns that added to reasonable suspicion.

Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot argues that leaving Big Bend National Park early in the morning should not contribute to reasonable suspicion. He notes that Andrew P. Graham testified that it was not unusual for park visitors to get an early start on their trip home. However, Andrew P. Graham specifically testified that he did not believe he had ever seen a work vehicle leave Big Bend National Park on a Sunday morning and that such vehicles typically leave in groups at the end of the work day or work week. The traffic-pattern factor weighs in favor of reasonable suspicion.

Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass's previous experience in detecting illegal activity in the United States/Mexican border area, specifically around Alpine, Texas, and their knowledge of Texas Highway 385 as a route known for alien and narcotics smuggling, contributed to their suspicion.
