In the instant case, the district court found that the totality of the circumstances provided Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass with reasonable suspicion to warrant the stop of the truck in which Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot was driving. The court identified the following Brignoni-Ponce factors as supporting the validity of the stop.

Proximity to the border

One of the vital elements in the reasonable suspicion test is whether Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass had reason to believe that the vehicle in question recently crossed the border. Although this court does not adhere to a bright line test with regard to this factor, a car traveling more than 50 miles from the border is usually viewed as being too far from the border to support an inference that it originated its journey there. The proximity element is satisfied, though, if Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's car was first observed within 50 miles of the United States/Mexico border, but was stopped more than 50 miles from the border. See. If there is no reason to believe that the vehicle came from the border, the remaining factors must be examined charily.
