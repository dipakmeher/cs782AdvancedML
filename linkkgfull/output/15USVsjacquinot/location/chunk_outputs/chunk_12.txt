The district court determined that although the truck was first sighted by Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass approximately 75 miles from the border, the activation of vehicle sensors in an area much less than 50 miles from the border, the absence of major roads intersecting Highway 385 between the border and the point where the truck was first sighted, and the arrival of the vehicle at a time consistent with the sensor alerts "unquestionably indicated" that the truck was traveling through an area very close to the border prior to the stop. The district court's finding in this regard was not clearly erroneous; the finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole. The district court went on to conclude that the proximity-to-the-border element supported Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass' reasonable suspicion determination.
