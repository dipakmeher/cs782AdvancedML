The second vehicle was a large white Ford pickup truck with a lot of equipment in its bed; it appeared to be a work truck and did not have a park sticker on its windshield. Andrew P. Graham was able to see only that the driver was a small-framed person wearing a baseball cap. Andrew P. Graham was surprised to see a work truck coming out of Big Bend National Park on a Sunday morning before six o'clock. He normally saw construction vehicles leaving Big Bend National Park in groups at the end of the work day or on Friday evenings at the end of the work week. The truck bore a Kansas license plate, which made Andrew P. Graham suspicious because Big Bend National Park typically hires contractors from the Alpine, Texas area. Additionally, Andrew P. Graham was aware of a recent narcotics smuggling operation in the Alpine, Texas area destined for locations in Kansas.
