Based on Andrew P. Graham's testimony that Texas Highway 385 has a reputation as a smuggling route, the district court concluded that the characteristics of the area supported a finding of reasonable suspicion. While Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot does not dispute that Texas Highway 385 is a notorious smuggling route, he notes that it is also a major highway used by thousands of visitors to Big Bend National Park, citing . And he points out that this court has cautioned that a vehicle's mere presence on a road frequently used for illegal activity is not sufficient to justify a stop, citing .

Nevertheless, "it is well established that a road's reputation as a smuggling route adds to the reasonableness of the agents' suspicion." (emphasis added) (quotation and citation omitted). This factor weighs in favor of reasonable suspicion.

Usual traffic patterns

Andrew P. Graham testified that traffic is typically very light coming out of Big Bend National Park before six o'clock in the morning and that he was surprised to see a work truck leaving Big Bend National Park so early on a Sunday morning. The district court thus considered the truck's presence on Texas Highway 385 at that time to be a deviation from the typical traffic patterns that added to reasonable suspicion.
