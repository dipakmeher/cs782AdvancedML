Agent Andrew P. Graham got to within two car lengths of the large white Ford pickup truck to read the registration and then followed the large white Ford pickup truck from ten car lengths. Agents Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass continued to follow the large white Ford pickup truck while they awaited registration information on it. The large white Ford pickup truck slowed to fifteen miles per hour below the average speed limit. Typically, Agent Andrew P. Graham does not see vehicles dramatically change their speed unless the vehicle was not traveling the speed limit before being followed by an agent. The agents were unable to obtain the registration information because of computer-system problems, but they continued to follow the large white Ford pickup truck. As the large white Ford pickup truck approached Marathon, Texas, it stopped at a stop sign, activated its left turn signal, and then remained stopped for five seconds before turning left onto Highway 90. Agent Andrew P. Graham found the large white Ford pickup truck's pause at the stop sign to be much longer than what he normally sees. Agent Andrew P. Graham also found the large white Ford pickup truck's left turn to be strange because most vehicles coming up Texas Highway 385 would continue straight on that road toward Fort Stockton and Interstate 10. By turning left, the large white Ford pickup truck began traveling toward Alpine, Texas; however, the most direct and logical route of travel from Big Bend National Park to Alpine, Texas is Highway 118. In Agent Andrew P. Graham's experience, most visitors to such a remote area with limited gas stations have a map and know which roads to take.
