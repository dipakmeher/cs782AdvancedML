At approximately 6:45 a.m., Andrew P. Graham observed two vehicles pass by his location. Andrew P. Graham believed that these were the vehicles that had activated the first sensor within Big Bend National Park, and he and Jay Snodgrass began to follow them in separate marked Border Patrol vehicles. The first vehicle that had passed the agents' location was a late model four-door sedan carrying an older Anglo couple and bearing a Big Bend National Park registration receipt taped to the windshield and a Mississippi license plate. The vehicle appeared typical of the tourist traffic coming out of Big Bend National Park. Andrew P. Graham got directly behind the vehicle to check its registration, and the vehicle continued to drive normally. Andrew P. Graham concluded that the first vehicle was probably not involved in any illegal activity.
