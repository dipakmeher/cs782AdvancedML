Although deceleration in the presence of a patrol car may be completely innocent behavior, United States has noted that such behavior may be suspicious if the driver was not speeding when first observed. See. And while it is questionable whether the truck's five-second pause at the stop sign and adherence to the school zone speed limit were especially suspicious, the truck's indirect travel route from Big Bend National Park to Alpine, Texas does trigger suspicion. See (approving the district court's consideration of an indirect route as a factor supporting reasonable suspicion). This circuit affords due weight to the inferences law enforcement officers draw from historical facts and the events leading up to a stop. Id. Considering the totality of the driver's behavior, this factor weighs in favor of reasonable suspicion.

Particular aspects of the vehicle

Andrew P. Graham testified that the truck: was not a tourist-type vehicle, but a work vehicle carrying tool boxes, a gas tank, and an air tank; did not have a park sticker on its windshield, indicating that it had not been in any tourist areas of Big Bend National Park for any length of time; and bore a Kansas license plate, although Big Bend National Park uses local contractors. The district court did not err in determining that the appearance of the truck contributed to Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass's reasonable suspicion.
