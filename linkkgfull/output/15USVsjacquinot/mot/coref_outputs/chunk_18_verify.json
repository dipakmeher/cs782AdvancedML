    "late model four-door sedan": "Tourist vehicle with Mississippi license plate and Big Bend National Park registration, carrying an older Anglo couple",
    "large white Ford pickup truck": "a large white work truck with a Kansas license plate, suspected of being involved in narcotics smuggling, exhibited unusual driving behavior near Marathon, Texas, carrying tool boxes, a spare gas tank, an air tank, and containing two unloaded handguns. The vehicle was stopped approximately 75 miles from the United States/Mexican border and had recently traveled through an area very close to the United States/Mexico border prior to the stop. It was seen leaving Big Bend National Park early on a Sunday morning, which is unusual given the typical light traffic at that time. The truck was being followed by Agent Andrew P. Graham and did not have a park sticker on its windshield. The truck's occupant was stopped based on reasonable suspicion of engaging in illegal activity and was found with 286.44 pounds of marijuana in a toolbox in the bed of the truck. The driver appeared to be a small-framed person wearing a baseball cap. The vehicle slowed to fifteen miles per hour below the average speed limit and made an unusual left turn onto Highway 90. The truck drove through Marathon, Texas at 20 miles per hour in a school zone with no pedestrians or other vehicles present. Activated vehicle sensors in an area less than 50 miles from the border. The district court found that the truck had traveled through an area very close to the United States/Mexico border prior to the stop. Left Big Bend National Park early on a Sunday morning, deviating from typical traffic patterns. Unusual for work vehicles to leave the park alone on a Sunday morning. Exhibited suspicious behavior while being followed by Agent Andrew P. Graham. Did not have a park sticker on its windshield and had a Kansas license plate. Involved in a case where the driver was stopped based on reasonable suspicion of engaging in illegal activity, with the truck's occupants suspected of narcotics smuggling. Contained two unloaded handguns and 286.44 pounds of marijuana. The truck also had a lot of equipment in its bed. Made an unusual pause at a stop sign before turning left onto Highway 90. Stopped by Agent Andrew P. Graham approximately 70 or 80 miles from the United States/Mexican border. Was first sighted by Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass approximately 75 miles from the United States/Mexican border. Deviated from typical traffic patterns by leaving Big Bend National Park early on a Sunday morning. Slowed dramatically to fifteen miles per hour below the speed limit, remained stopped at a stop sign for five seconds, made an unusual turn and traveled toward Alpine, Texas on Highway 118, and obeyed a school zone sign that limited speeds while flashing.
