    "unknown vehicle": "Vehicle involved in a roving United States/Mexican border patrol stop",
    "late model four-door sedan": "Tourist vehicle with Mississippi license plate and Big Bend National Park registration",
    "large white Ford pickup truck": "a large white work truck with a Kansas license plate, suspected of being involved in narcotics smuggling, exhibited unusual driving behavior near Marathon, Texas, carrying tool boxes, a spare gas tank, an air tank, and containing two unloaded handguns. The vehicle was stopped approximately 75 miles from the United States/Mexican border and had recently traveled through an area very close to the United States/Mexico border prior to the stop. It was seen leaving Big Bend National Park early on a Sunday morning, which is unusual given the typical light traffic at that time. The truck was being followed by Agent Andrew P. Graham and did not have a park sticker on its windshield."
