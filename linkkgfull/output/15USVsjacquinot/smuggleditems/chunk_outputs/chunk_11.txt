In the instant case, the U.S. District Court found that the totality of the circumstances provided United States/Mexican Border Patrol with reasonable suspicion to warrant the stop of the large white Ford pickup truck in which Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot was driving. The U.S. District Court identified the following Brignoni-Ponce factors as supporting the validity of the stop.

Proximity to the United States/Mexican Border

One of the vital elements in the reasonable suspicion test is whether United States/Mexican Border Patrol had reason to believe that the large white Ford pickup truck in question recently crossed the United States/Mexican Border. Although this circuit does not adhere to a bright line test with regard to this factor, a car traveling more than 50 miles from the United States/Mexican Border is usually viewed as being too far from the United States/Mexican Border to support an inference that it originated its journey there. The proximity element is satisfied, though, if Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's large white Ford pickup truck was first observed within 50 miles of the United States/Mexican Border, but was stopped more than 50 miles from the United States/Mexican Border. See. If there is no reason to believe that the large white Ford pickup truck came from the United States/Mexican Border, the remaining factors must be examined charily.
