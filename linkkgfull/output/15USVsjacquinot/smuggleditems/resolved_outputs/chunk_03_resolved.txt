In the early morning hours of Sunday, January 16, 2000, Agents Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass, who are part of the United States/Mexican Border Patrol, were parked on Texas Highway 385, approximately 75 miles north of the United States/Mexican Border. At 5:45 a.m., the agents, who are law enforcement officers of the United States/Mexican Border Patrol, were notified by Marfa Sector Area Operations Center Communications that vehicle sensors located inside Big Bend National Park and well within 50 miles of the United States/Mexican Border had indicated a large white Ford pickup truck and another vehicle traveling from within the park. The area in which the sensors are located is very remote and is intersected only by ranch roads. The fact that two vehicles activated the sensors at approximately the same time made Agent Andrew P. Graham, an agent of the United States/Mexican Border Patrol, suspicious that one may be a lead car and the other a load car carrying contraband. Subsequent vehicle sensors were triggered, indicating to Agent Andrew P. Graham, a member of the United States/Mexican Border Patrol, that the large white Ford pickup truck and another vehicle that had triggered the first sensor were continuing toward their location.
