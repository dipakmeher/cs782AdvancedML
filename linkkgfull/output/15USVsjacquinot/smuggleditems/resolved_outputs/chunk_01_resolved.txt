Michael Brett Jacquinot is a defendant.

PER CURIAM:

Michael Brett Jacquinot appeals his conditional guilty plea conviction and sentence for possession with intent to distribute narcotics cases. Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot argues that the U.S. District Court erred by: (1) denying Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's motion to suppress the evidence obtained from a roving United States/Mexican Border Patrol stop of the large white Ford pickup truck in which Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot was a passenger and (2) applying to increase Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's base offense level for possession of two unloaded handguns. We affirm.
