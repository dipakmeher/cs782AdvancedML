The U.S. District Court's decision to apply is a factual determination reviewable for clear error. provides for a two-level increase in the offense level for narcotics cases "if a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed." "The United States Government has the burden of proof under  of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapons, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant." (internal quotation and citation omitted). "Applying this standard, the United States Government must provide evidence that the weapons were found in the same location where narcotics cases or narcotics paraphernalia are stored or where part of the transaction occurred." Id. (internal quotation and citation omitted). The adjustment should be applied if the weapons were present, unless the defendant establishes that it was clearly improbable that the weapons were connected with the narcotics cases. See ,  comment.
