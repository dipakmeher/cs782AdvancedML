There is no merit to Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's argument that because he was not charged with the offense of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense and because Agent Andrew P. Graham's memo stated that the two unloaded handguns were not loaded, no attempt was made to use them, and there was no evidence that the two unloaded handguns had been intended for use against United States/Mexican Border Patrol, it is clearly improbable that the two unloaded handguns were connected to his narcotics cases. For purposes of the adjustment, "it is not necessary for possession of the two unloaded handguns . . . to be sufficiently connected with the crime to warrant prosecution as an independent firearm offense." And it is not material that the two unloaded handguns were not loaded; 2D1.1(b)(1) is an added punishment for narcotics cases who heighten the danger of narcotics cases by possessing a dangerous weapon, and the mere presence of the two unloaded handguns, loaded or not, can escalate the danger. See. Finally, it does not matter whether Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot actually used or intended to use the two unloaded handguns in his narcotics cases; the pertinent fact is that "they could have been so used." (emphasis added). Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's sentence must therefore be affirmed.

III. CONCLUSION

Based on the foregoing, this circuit affirm Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's conviction and sentence.

AFFIRMED
