United States/Mexican Border Patrol agents testified that the large white Ford pickup truck: was not a tourist-type vehicle, but a work vehicle carrying tool boxes, a gas tank, and an air tank; did not have a park sticker on its windshield, indicating that it had not been in any tourist areas of Big Bend National Park for any length of time; and bore a Kansas license plate, although Big Bend National Park uses local contractors. The U.S. District Court did not err in determining that the appearance of the large white Ford pickup truck contributed to United States/Mexican Border Patrol's reasonable suspicion.

Although the U.S. District Court did not specifically address it, the factor regarding information about recent illegal trafficking in alien or narcotics cases in the area is also relevant in this case. United States/Mexican Border Patrol agents testified that he was personally aware of "a lot of" recent narcotics cases taking place through the Alpine, Texas area that was destined for locations in Kansas. Since the large white Ford pickup truck in question bore a Kansas license plate, this information weighs in favor of United States/Mexican Border Patrol's reasonable suspicion determination.
