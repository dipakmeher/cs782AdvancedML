Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot argues that leaving Big Bend National Park early in the morning should not contribute to reasonable suspicion. He notes that Agent Andrew P. Graham testified that it was not unusual for park visitors to get an early start on their trip home. However, Agent Andrew P. Graham specifically testified that he did not believe he had ever seen a work vehicle, or more specifically, a large white Ford pickup truck, leave Big Bend National Park on a Sunday morning and that such vehicles typically leave in groups at the end of the work day or work week. The traffic-pattern factor weighs in favor of reasonable suspicion.

Agent Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass's previous experience in detecting illegal activity in the United States/Mexican Border Patrol area, specifically around Alpine, Texas, and their knowledge of Texas Highway 385 as a route known for alien smuggling cases and narcotics cases contributed to their suspicion.

Agent Andrew P. Graham testified that he had three years' experience serving as a United States/Mexican Border Patrol agent in Alpine, Texas and that Agent Jay Snodgrass had eleven years' experience as a United States/Mexican Border Patrol agent, with a few months of that experience in Alpine, Texas. The U.S. District Court concluded that the agents' previous experience in Alpine, Texas contributed to the reasonable suspicion determination. This factor supports the stop.
