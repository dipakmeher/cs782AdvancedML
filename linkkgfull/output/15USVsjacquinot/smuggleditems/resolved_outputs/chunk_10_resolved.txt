A United States/Mexican Border Patrol agent, such as United States/Mexican Border Patrol agents like Agent Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass, conducting a roving patrol may make a temporary investigative stop of a vehicle only if the agent is aware of specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicle's occupant, such as Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot, is engaged in criminal activity. See ; . Factors that may be considered in an analysis of reasonable suspicion include: (1) proximity to the United States/Mexican Border; (2) characteristics of the area; (3) usual traffic patterns; (4) agent's previous experience in detecting illegal activity; (5) behavior of the driver, such as Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot; (6) particular aspects or characteristics of the vehicle; (7) information about recent alien smuggling cases or narcotics cases in the area; and (8) the number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers, including Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot. ; see also .
