Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot asserts that the proximity-to-the-United States/Mexican Border factor should weigh against a finding of reasonable suspicion, as Agent Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass had no reason to believe that his large white Ford pickup truck had recently crossed the United States/Mexican Border. However, given the U.S. District Court's accepted factual finding that the precipitate events clearly indicated that the large white Ford pickup truck had traveled through an area very close to the United States/Mexican Border prior to the stop, Agent Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass did in fact have a reason to believe that the large white Ford pickup truck had recently crossed the United States/Mexican Border. Therefore, this factor does provide support for the stop. Cf. (rejecting proximity-to-the-United States/Mexican Border factor where vehicle was stopped 60 miles from the United States/Mexican Border and there was no independent reason to believe that the vehicle had not started its journey in either of the two towns between the United States/Mexican Border and the area of the stop).
