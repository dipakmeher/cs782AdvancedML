    "large white Ford pickup truck": "vehicle involved in the stop by United States/Mexican Border Patrol, suspected of being a lead car, with equipment including tool boxes, a spare gas tank, and an air tank in its bed, bearing a Kansas license plate, exhibited unusual driving behavior near Marathon, Texas, and was stopped 70 or 80 miles from the United States/Mexican Border, containing two unloaded handguns, subject of a motion to suppress evidence, driven by Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot, traveled through an area very close to the United States/Mexican Border prior to the stop, with proximity to the border being a factor in the stop, and was seen leaving Big Bend National Park early on a Sunday morning, deviating from typical traffic patterns, raising suspicion due to its unusual departure time, slowed dramatically to fifteen miles per hour below the speed limit, remained stopped at a stop sign for five seconds, made an unusual turn and traveled toward Alpine, Texas on Highway 118",
    "Agent Andrew P. Graham": "testified about the large white Ford pickup truck's behavior, including slowing down and making an unusual turn",
    "U.S. District Court": "concluded that the driver's behavior added to the United States/Mexican Border Patrol agents' reasonable suspicion",
    "Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot": "driver of the large white Ford pickup truck, who asserts that the proximity-to-the-United States/Mexican Border Patrol factor should weigh against a finding of reasonable suspicion, and notes that Texas Highway 385 is also a major highway used by thousands of visitors to Big Bend National Park, argues that it was not suspicious for the large white Ford pickup truck to slow down after Andrew P. Graham followed it",
    "United States/Mexican Border Patrol": "agency that stopped the large white Ford pickup truck and observed its unusual behavior"
