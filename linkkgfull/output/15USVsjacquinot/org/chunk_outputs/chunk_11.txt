In the instant case, the district court found that the totality of the circumstances provided Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass with reasonable suspicion to warrant the stop of the large white Ford pickup truck in which Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot was driving. The court identified the following Brignoni-Ponce factors as supporting the validity of the stop.

Proximity to the United States/Mexican border

One of the vital elements in the reasonable suspicion test is whether Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass had reason to believe that the large white Ford pickup truck in question recently crossed the United States/Mexican border. Although this circuit does not adhere to a bright line test with regard to this factor, a car traveling more than 50 miles from the United States/Mexican border is usually viewed as being too far from the United States/Mexican border to support an inference that it originated its journey there. The proximity element is satisfied, though, if Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's large white Ford pickup truck was first observed within 50 miles of the United States/Mexican border, but was stopped more than 50 miles from the United States/Mexican border. See. If there is no reason to believe that the large white Ford pickup truck came from the United States/Mexican border, the remaining factors must be examined charily.
