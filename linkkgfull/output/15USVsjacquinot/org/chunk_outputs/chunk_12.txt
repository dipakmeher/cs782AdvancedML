The district court determined that although the large white Ford pickup truck was first sighted by Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass approximately 75 miles from the United States/Mexican border, the activation of vehicle sensors in an area much less than 50 miles from the United States/Mexican border, the absence of major roads intersecting Texas Highway 385 between the United States/Mexican border and the point where the large white Ford pickup truck was first sighted, and the arrival of the vehicle at a time consistent with the sensor alerts "unquestionably indicated" that the large white Ford pickup truck was traveling through an area very close to the United States/Mexican border prior to the stop. The district court's finding in this regard was not clearly erroneous; the finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole. The district court went on to conclude that the proximity-to-the-border element supported Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass' reasonable suspicion determination.
