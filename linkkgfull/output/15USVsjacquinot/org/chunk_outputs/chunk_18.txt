Although the district court did not specifically address it, the factor regarding information about recent illegal trafficking in aliens or narcotics in the area is also relevant in this case. Agent Andrew P. Graham testified that he was personally aware of "a lot of" recent narcotics smuggling taking place through the Alpine, Texas area that was destined for locations in Kansas. Since the large white Ford pickup truck in question bore a Kansas license plate, this information weighs in favor of Andrew P. Graham's reasonable suspicion determination.

Finally, as there is no indication in the record that Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot, the large white Ford pickup truck's only passenger, caused any suspicion, the factor regarding the number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers is the sole factor that does not support Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass's reasonable suspicion determination. See (stating that not every Brignoni-Ponce factor need weigh in favor of reasonable suspicion and that an officer need not eliminate all reasonable possibility of innocent travel before conducting an investigatory stop).

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and considering the totality of the circumstances, the district court did not err in denying Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's motion to suppress, as Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass's stop of the large white Ford pickup truck in which he was riding was based on reasonable suspicion that the large white Ford pickup truck's occupants were engaged in illegal activity.
