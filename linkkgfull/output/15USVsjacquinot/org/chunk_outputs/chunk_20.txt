A PSR is generally considered sufficiently reliable to be considered by the district court as evidence in making the factual determinations required by the sentencing guidelines. In the present case, the district court adopted the PSR's findings that 286.44 pounds of marijuana were found in a toolbox in the bed of the large white Ford pickup truck in which Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot was riding and that two unloaded handguns were found in the cab of the large white Ford pickup truck. Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot does not contest these findings and even acknowledges that ammunition was also found in the large white Ford pickup truck. Accordingly, the district court did not err, clearly or otherwise, in finding that was applicable because there was a temporal and spatial relationship between Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot, the guns, and his drug trafficking offense.
