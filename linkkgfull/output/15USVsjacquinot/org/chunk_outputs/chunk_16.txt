Agent Andrew P. Graham testified that as he followed the large white Ford pickup truck, it: slowed dramatically to fifteen miles per hour below the speed limit, although it had not previously been speeding; remained stopped at a stop sign for five seconds; made an unusual turn and traveled toward Alpine, Texas on Highway 118; and obeyed a school zone sign that limited speeds while flashing, although the sign was not then flashing. The district court concluded that the driver's behavior added to the agents' reasonable suspicion.

Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot argues that it was not suspicious for the large white Ford pickup truck to slow down after Andrew P. Graham followed it within two car lengths, passed it, and then got behind it again. He further contends that it would not be unusual for a prudent out-of-state traveler to stop at the Texas Highway 385 and Highway 90 intersection for five seconds to determine the way to Alpine, Texas, or to travel at Highway 90's posted speed limit of 20 miles per hour.
