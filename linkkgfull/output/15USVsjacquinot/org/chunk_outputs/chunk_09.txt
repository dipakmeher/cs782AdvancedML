Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the stop of the large white Ford pickup truck. He contends that the circumstances known to Andrew P. Graham and Jay Snodgrass did not give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the large white Ford pickup truck was involved in illegal activities.

In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, the district court's factual findings are reviewed for clear error, and its legal conclusions, including whether there was reasonable suspicion for a stop, are reviewed de novo. A factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. Further, "the evidence presented at a pre-trial hearing on a motion to suppress is viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party."
