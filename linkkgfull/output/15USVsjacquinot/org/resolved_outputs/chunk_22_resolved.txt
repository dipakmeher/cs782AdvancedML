Concur

Judge Robert M. Parker, Circuit Judge, specially concurring.

The  absurdity of our jurisprudence, as it relates to the United States/Mexican Border,  is well illustrated by Judge Wiener's dissent in  .  In addition to the factual scenarios    he lists in his dissent that we have judicially blessed, we can now  add spending five seconds at a Stop sign prior to turning left, and  driving 20 mph through a school zone when the blinking light was  off.

The  stop was seventy-five miles from the United States/Mexican Border, well beyond our  artificial fifty mile limit. There is no evidence that the large white Ford pickup truck had crossed the United States/Mexican Border. The articulated reason of lead  car/following car had been dispelled, a fact which decreases the  relevance that at some point (undisclosed for security purposes)  within Big Bend National Park two vehicles passed a sensor. The officers also  mentioned the highly suspicious slowing within the speed limit as  the defendants were being followed and the Kansas license plate on  the large white Ford pickup truck. This last point had particular significance for one of  the officers, since at one point in his career he made a case  involving a Kansas destination.
