Although deceleration in the presence of a patrol car may be  completely innocent behavior, this court has noted that such  behavior may be suspicious if the driver was not speeding when first  observed. See .  And while it is questionable whether the truck's five-second pause  at the stop sign and adherence to the school zone speed limit were  especially suspicious, the truck's indirect travel route from Big  Bend to Alpine does trigger suspicion. See (approving the district court's consideration of an indirect    route as a factor supporting reasonable suspicion). This court  affords due weight to the inferences law enforcement officers draw  from historical facts and the events leading up    to a stop. Id. Considering the totality of the driver's behavior, this factor  weighs in favor of reasonable suspicion.

Particular  aspects of the vehicle

Agent  Graham testified that the truck: was not a tourist-type vehicle, but  a work vehicle carrying tool boxes, a gas tank, and an air tank; did  not have a park sticker on its windshield, indicating that it had  not been in any tourist areas of the park for any length of time;  and bore a Kansas license plate, although the park uses local  contractors. The district court did not err in determining that the  appearance of the truck contributed to the agents' reasonable  suspicion.
