An  evidentiary hearing was held on Jacquinot's motion. Border Patrol  Agent Andrew P. Graham, a three-year veteran of the    Border Patrol, testified that he and eleven-year veteran Border  Patrol Agent Jay Snodgrass were stationed in Alpine, Texas, and were  assigned to patrol a 140-mile area of the United States/Mexican  border, including the Big Bend National Park. While Graham's patrol  experience was all in the Alpine, Texas, area, Snodgrass had  transferred to Alpine a few months earlier, having previously served  at the Marfa Sector Area Operations Center and the Laredo , Texas ,  border area. During his tenure with the Border Patrol, Graham had  been involved with at least 30 narcotics cases and 15 to 20 alien  smuggling cases.

Texas  Highway 385 is notorious for smuggling, and in the prior six months,  Agent Graham had noticed an increase in alien and smuggling  apprehensions on that highway. Agent Graham attributed this increase  in activity on Highway 385 to the Border Patrol's enhanced  enforcement on other nearby highways.
