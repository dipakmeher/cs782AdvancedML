A PSR is generally considered sufficiently reliable to be considered  by the trial court as evidence in making the factual determinations  required by the sentencing guidelines. .  In the present case, the district court adopted the PSR's findings  that 286.44 pounds of marijuana were found in a toolbox in the bed  of the truck in which Jacquinot was riding and that two unloaded  handguns were found in the cab of the truck. Jacquinot does not  contest these findings and even acknowledges that ammunition was  also found in the truck. Accordingly, the district court did not  err, clearly or otherwise, in finding that was applicable because there was a temporal and spatial relationship  between Jacquinot, the    guns, and his drug trafficking offense. See (applying adjustment where shotgun found in truck of vehicle used to transport  drugs), vacated  on other grounds by  ; (applying adjustment where gun found under the seat of car used in attempted  theft of narcotics).
