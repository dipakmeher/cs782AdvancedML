Nevertheless,  "it is well established that a road's reputation as a smuggling  route adds to the reasonableness of the agents' suspicion." (emphasis added) (quotation and citation omitted). This factor  weighs in favor of reasonable suspicion.

Usual  traffic patterns

Agent  Graham testified that traffic is typically very light coming out of  Big Bend before six o'clock in the morning and that he was surprised  to see a work truck leaving the park so early on a Sunday morning.  The district court thus considered the truck's presence on the  highway at that time to be a deviation from the typical traffic  patterns that added to reasonable suspicion.

Jacquinot  argues that leaving Big Bend early in the morning should not  contribute to reasonable suspicion. He notes that Agent Graham  testified that it was not unusual for park visitors    to get an early start on their trip home. However, Agent Graham  specifically testified that he did not believe he had ever seen a  work vehicle leave the park on a Sunday morning and that such  vehicles typically leave in groups at the end of the work day or  work week. The traffic-pattern factor weighs in favor of reasonable  suspicion.
