A border patrol agent conducting a roving patrol may make a  temporary investigative stop of a vehicle only if the agent is aware  of specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences  from those facts, that reasonably warrant    suspicion that the vehicle's occupant is engaged in criminal  activity. See ; .  Factors that may be considered in an analysis of reasonable  suspicion include: (1) proximity to the border; (2) characteristics  of the area; (3) usual traffic patterns; (4) agent's previous  experience in detecting illegal activity; (5) behavior of the  driver; (6) particular aspects or characteristics of the vehicle;  (7) information about recent illegal trafficking in aliens or  narcotics in the area; and (8) the number, appearance, and behavior  of the passengers. ; see  also .   The reasonable suspicion analysis is a fact-intensive test in which  the court looks at all circumstances together to weigh not the  individual layers, but the laminated total. (5th Cir.),  .  Factors that ordinarily constitute    innocent    behavior may provide a composite picture sufficient to raise  reasonable suspicion in the minds of experienced officers. Id.
