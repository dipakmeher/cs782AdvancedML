The  second vehicle was a large white Ford pickup truck with a lot of  equipment in its bed; it appeared to be a work truck and did not  have a park sticker on its windshield. Agent Graham was able to see  only that the driver was a small-framed person wearing a baseball  cap. Agent Graham was surprised to see a work truck coming out of  the park on a Sunday morning before six o'clock. He normally saw  construction vehicles leaving the park in groups at the end of the  work day or on Friday evenings at the end of the work week. The  truck bore a Kansas license plate, which made Agent Graham  suspicious because the park typically hires contractors from the  local area. Additionally, Agent Graham was aware of a recent  narcotics smuggling operation in the Alpine area destined for  locations in Kansas.
