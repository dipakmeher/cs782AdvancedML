At  approximately 6:45 a.m., Agent Graham observed two vehicles pass by  his location. Agent Graham believed that these were the vehicles  that had activated the first sensor within the park, and he and  Agent Snodgrass began to follow them in separate marked Border  Patrol vehicles. The first vehicle that had passed the agents'  location was a late model four-door sedan carrying an older Anglo  couple and bearing a park registration receipt taped    to the windshield and a Mississippi license plate. The vehicle  appeared typical of the tourist traffic coming out of the park.  Agent Graham got directly behind the    vehicle to check its registration, and the vehicle continued to  drive normally. Agent Graham concluded that the first vehicle was  probably not involved in any illegal activity.
