Although  the district court did not specifically address it, the factor  regarding information about recent illegal trafficking in aliens or  narcotics in the area is also relevant in this case. Agent Graham  testified that he was personally aware of "a lot of"  recent narcotics smuggling taking place through the Alpine area that  was destined for locations in Kansas. Since the truck    in question bore a Kansas license plate, this information weighs in  favor of Agent Graham's reasonable suspicion determination.

Finally,  as there is no indication in the record that Jacquinot, the truck's  only passenger, caused any suspicion, the factor regarding the  number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers is the sole  factor that does not support the agents' reasonable suspicion  determination. See (stating that not every Brignoni-Ponce factor need weigh in favor of reasonable suspicion and that an  officer need not eliminate all reasonable possibility of innocent  travel before conducting an investigatory stop).

Viewing  the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and  considering the totality of the circumstances, the district court  did not err in denying Jacquinot's motion to suppress, as the border  patrol agents' stop of the truck in which he was riding was based on  reasonable suspicion that the truck's occupants were engaged in  illegal activity.
