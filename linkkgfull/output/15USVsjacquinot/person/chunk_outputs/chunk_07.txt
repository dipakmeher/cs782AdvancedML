The  truck then drove through Marathon at 20 miles per hour. There  was    a school zone sign limiting speeds to 20 miles per hour when the  sign was flashing, but the sign was not flashing, it was a Sunday  morning, and there were no pedestrians, children, or other vehicles  on the street. Agent Graham felt that the truck was trying to avoid  being pulled over. Agent Graham confirmed Agent Snodgrass' prior  observation that the truck was carrying tool boxes, a spare gas  tank, and an air tank. After following the truck for a total of  approximately fifteen minutes, Graham determined that it was more  likely than not that the truck was involved in illegal activity. His  determination was based on: the unusual hour that this apparently  non-tourist work vehicle left the park; the truck's Kansas license  plate, since he had personal experience with a smuggling  organization transporting marijuana from the Big Bend area to  Kansas; the absence of a park registration sticker on the vehicle,  indicating that it had not been in the park for any length of time;  the fact that the truck appeared to have transited the park from the  west side to the east side, which was a tactic smugglers had  recently    been using to circumvent Border Patrol traffic or checkpoint  operations; Highway    385's reputation for the smuggling  of aliens and narcotics; and the driver's behavior when they were following  the truck. Agent Graham stopped the truck 70 or 80 miles from the  United States/Mexico border.
