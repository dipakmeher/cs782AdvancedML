Agent  Graham testified that he had three years' experience serving as a  Border Patrol agent in the Alpine area and that Agent Snodgrass had  eleven years' experience as a Border Patrol agent, with a few months  of that experience in the Alpine area. The district court concluded  that the agents' previous experience in the region contributed to  the reasonable suspicion determination. This factor supports the  stop.

Behavior  of the driver

Agent  Graham testified that as he followed the truck, it: slowed  dramatically to fifteen miles per hour below the speed limit,  although it had not previously been speeding; remained stopped at a  stop sign for five seconds; made an unusual turn and traveled toward  Alpine on an indirect route; and obeyed a school zone sign that  limited speeds while flashing,    although the sign was not then flashing. The district court  concluded that the driver's behavior added to the agents' reasonable  suspicion.

Jacquinot  argues that it was not suspicious for the truck to slow down after  Agent Graham followed it within two car lengths, passed it, and then  got behind it again. He further contends that it would not be  unusual for a prudent out-of-state traveler to stop at the Highway  385 and Highway 90 intersection for five seconds to determine the  way to the nearest town, which was Alpine, or to travel at Highway  90's posted speed limit of 20 miles per hour.
