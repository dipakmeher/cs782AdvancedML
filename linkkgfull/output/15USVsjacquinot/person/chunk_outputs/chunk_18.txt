Jacquinot  also contends that    the district court erred in applying 's  two-level upward adjustment for possession of a weapon in connection  with a drug trafficking offense. Jacquinot argues that although  there were two unloaded handguns in the truck, the Government failed  to prove that it was not clearly improbable that he possessed those  handguns in connection with his drug offense.

The district court's decision to apply is a factual determination reviewable for clear error. .  provides for a two-level increase in the offense level for a drug  trafficking offense "if a dangerous weapon (including a  firearm) was possessed." "The government has the burden of  proof under of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a temporal and  spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking  activity, and the defendant." (internal quotation and citation omitted). "Applying this  standard, the government must provide evidence that the weapon was  found in the same location where drugs or drug paraphernalia    are stored or where part of the transaction occurred." Id. (internal quotation and citation omitted). The adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless the  defendant establishes that it was clearly improbable that the weapon    was connected with the offense. See  ,  comment.
