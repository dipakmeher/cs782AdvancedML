An evidentiary hearing was held on Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's motion. United States/Mexican Border Patrol Agent Andrew P. Graham, a three-year veteran of the United States/Mexican Border Patrol, testified that he and eleven-year veteran United States/Mexican Border Patrol Agent Jay Snodgrass were stationed in Alpine, Texas, and were assigned to patrol a 140-mile area of the United States/Mexican Border, including the Big Bend National Park. While Andrew P. Graham's patrol experience was all in the Alpine, Texas, area, Jay Snodgrass had transferred to Alpine a few months earlier, having previously served at the Marfa Sector Area Operations Center and the Laredo, Texas, border area. During his tenure with the United States/Mexican Border Patrol, Andrew P. Graham had been involved with at least 30 narcotics cases and 15 to 20 alien smuggling cases.

Texas Highway 385 is notorious for smuggling, and in the prior six months, Andrew P. Graham had noticed an increase in alien and smuggling apprehensions on that highway. Andrew P. Graham attributed this increase in activity on Texas Highway 385 to the United States/Mexican Border Patrol's enhanced enforcement on other nearby highways.
