The U.S. District Court determined that although the large white Ford pickup truck was first sighted by United States/Mexican Border Patrol approximately 75 miles from the United States/Mexican Border, the activation of vehicle sensors in an area much less than 50 miles from the United States/Mexican Border, the absence of major roads intersecting Texas Highway 385 between the United States/Mexican Border and the point where the large white Ford pickup truck was first sighted, and the arrival of the vehicle at a time consistent with the sensor alerts "unquestionably indicated" that the large white Ford pickup truck was traveling through an area very close to the United States/Mexican Border prior to the stop. The U.S. District Court's finding in this regard was not clearly erroneous; the finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole. The U.S. District Court went on to conclude that the proximity-to-the-border element supported United States/Mexican Border Patrol's reasonable suspicion determination.
