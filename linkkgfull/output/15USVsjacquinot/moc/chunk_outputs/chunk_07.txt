The large white Ford pickup truck then drove through Marathon, Texas at 20 miles per hour. There was a school zone sign limiting speeds to 20 miles per hour when the sign was flashing, but the sign was not flashing, it was a Sunday morning, and there were no pedestrians, children, or other vehicles on the street. United States/Mexican Border Patrol felt that the large white Ford pickup truck was trying to avoid being pulled over. United States/Mexican Border Patrol confirmed Jay Snodgrass' prior observation that the large white Ford pickup truck was carrying tool boxes, a spare gas tank, and an air tank. After following the large white Ford pickup truck for a total of approximately fifteen minutes, United States/Mexican Border Patrol determined that it was more likely than not that the large white Ford pickup truck was involved in illegal activity. His determination was based on: the unusual hour that this apparently non-tourist work vehicle left Big Bend National Park; the large white Ford pickup truck's Kansas license plate, since he had personal experience with a smuggling organization transporting marijuana from the Big Bend National Park area to Kansas; the absence of a park registration sticker on the vehicle, indicating that it had not been in Big Bend National Park for any length of time; the fact that the large white Ford pickup truck appeared to have transited Big Bend National Park from the west side to the east side, which was a tactic smugglers had recently been using to circumvent United States/Mexican Border Patrol traffic or checkpoint operations; Texas Highway 385's reputation for the smuggling of aliens and narcotics; and the driver's behavior when they were following the large white Ford pickup truck. United States/Mexican Border Patrol stopped the large white Ford pickup truck 70 or 80 miles from the United States/Mexican Border.
