The large white Ford pickup truck was a large white Ford pickup truck with a lot of equipment in its bed; it appeared to be a work vehicle and did not have a park sticker on its windshield. Andrew P. Graham, an agent of the United States/Mexican Border Patrol, was able to see only that the driver was a small-framed person wearing a baseball cap. Andrew P. Graham, an agent of the United States/Mexican Border Patrol, was surprised to see a work vehicle coming out of Big Bend National Park on a Sunday morning before six o'clock. He normally saw construction vehicles leaving Big Bend National Park in groups at the end of the work day or on Friday evenings at the end of the work week. The large white Ford pickup truck bore a Kansas license plate, which made Andrew P. Graham, an agent of the United States/Mexican Border Patrol, suspicious because Big Bend National Park typically hires contractors from the Alpine, Texas area. Additionally, Andrew P. Graham, an agent of the United States/Mexican Border Patrol, was aware of a recent narcotics smuggling operation in the Alpine, Texas area destined for locations in Kansas.
