There is no merit to Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's argument that because he was not charged with the offense of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense and because Agent Jay Snodgrass' memo stated that the guns were not loaded, no attempt was made to use them, and there was no evidence that the guns had been intended for use against law enforcement officers, it is clearly improbable that the guns were connected to his drug trafficking offense. For purposes of the adjustment, "it is not necessary for possession of the weapon . . . to be sufficiently connected with the crime to warrant prosecution as an independent firearm offense." And it is not material that the guns were not loaded; 2D1.1(b)(1) is an added punishment for drug offenders who heighten the danger of drug trafficking by possessing a dangerous weapon, and the mere presence of a gun, loaded or not, can escalate the danger. See. Finally, it does not matter whether Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot actually used or intended to use the guns in his drug-trafficking offense; the pertinent fact is that "they could have been so used." (emphasis added). Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's sentence must therefore be affirmed.

III. CONCLUSION

Based on the foregoing, this circuit affirm Brignoni-Ponce Jacquinot's conviction and sentence.

AFFIRMED
