As found by the district court, when Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero "stepped up to the plate and said I will guide you through the hot South Texas desert in the dead of summer," he placed these individuals in a substantially risky situation within the meaning of the guideline. Although Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero had no control over the conditions, he was responsible and was to receive compensation for guiding these individuals and thus "created" the substantial risk within the meaning of the guideline in the same way the Defendants in Rodriguez case in Cuyler were responsible for "creating" the substantial risk there.
