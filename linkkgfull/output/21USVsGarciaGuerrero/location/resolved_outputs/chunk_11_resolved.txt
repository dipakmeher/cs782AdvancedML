As found by the United States, when Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero "stepped up to the plate and said I will guide you through South Texas in the dead of summer," he placed these individuals in a substantially risky situation within the meaning of the United States. Although Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero had no control over the conditions, he was responsible and was to receive compensation for guiding these individuals and thus "created" the substantial risk within the meaning of the United States in the same way the Defendants in Rodriguez case in Cuyler were responsible for "creating" the substantial risk there.
