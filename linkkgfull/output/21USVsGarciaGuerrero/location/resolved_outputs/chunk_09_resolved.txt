In this factually similar case, we too are persuaded to extend to the conduct at issue. We look at the entire picture. Here, the PSR indicates that the temperature on June 5, 2001 reached 100 degrees and the temperature on June 6, 2001 reached 105 degrees. Each of the aliens had only one bottle of water (which was depleted six hours after the journey began) and two cans of food, and several aliens told border patrol agents that they would have bought more water and food had Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero accurately advised them of the length of the journey. The aliens requested, and were denied, longer rest periods. The fact that one member of the group, Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez, died from "probable heat stroke" and two others required rather extensive hospitalization at Laredo underscores the dangerous nature of the trek through South Texas. We agree with United States that the conduct is covered by (1) Causation.
