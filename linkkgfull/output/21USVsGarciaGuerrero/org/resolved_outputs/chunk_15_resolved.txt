Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero also avers that the enhancement was nevertheless improper because the causal connection between the offense conduct and the death of Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez is weak. In a footnote, the Herrera Court states that "we assume . . . that for § (b)(6) to apply, the relevant death or injury must be causally connected to dangerous conditions covered by § (b)(5) created by the unlawful conduct . . . ." Id. at n.1; see also (enhancing the base offense level eight levels only "because Appellants were also subject to § (b)(5) for recklessly creating the substantial risk"). We need not decide whether a causal link between the substantially risky conduct (addressed under § (b)(5)) and the death of an individual (addressed under § (b)(6)) must exist for an enhancement under § (b)(6). Here, the conduct creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury (leading Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero, Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez, Jaime Gomez-Arroyo, and seven other undocumented aliens through the South Texas Trek in the middle of summer without adequate food, water, and rest periods) and the death of Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez are causally yoked such that adopting Herrera Court's pronouncement in footnote 1 is unnecessary. The autopsy report, the weather conditions, the lack of water and food, the manner of death, and the need for two other members of the group, namely Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero, Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez, Jaime Gomez-Arroyo, and seven other undocumented aliens, to also receive rather extensive medical treatment as a result of the extreme heat, all support the United States finding that Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez died from conditions encountered during the South Texas Journey.
