In  the late afternoon on June 6, 2001, border patrol agents from the Laredo South Station were notified by the ranch hand that an undocumented  female alien was in apparent distress at the La Moca Ranch. When  agents    and emergency technicians arrived at the ranch, they found the body  of Simon-Fernandez. As indicated by the PSR, the autopsy found the  sole cause of her death to be "probable heat stroke."

The  border patrol agents met with Gomez-Arroyo. In a search of the  surrounding area, they found the other members of the group, which  consisted of seven additional undocumented aliens and Garcia. Two of  the aliens in the group needed medical attention, and, according to  the probation officer at sentencing, were in the hospital for two  weeks recovering from their injuries.

In a sworn statement to a border patrol agent, Garcia stated that he  was the only guide for the group, that he was guiding the group to  San Antonio for financial gain ($ 400 per alien), and    that he had transported aliens through South Texas on two prior  occasions.
