As  stated, the guideline itself uses the phrase " creating a substantial risk." (2001)  (emphasis added). However, Congress, through the Illegal Immigration  Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208,  110 Stat. 566 ("IIRIRA"), directed the Sentencing  Commission to allow for the imposition of "an appropriate  sentencing enhancement on a defendant who, in the course of  committing an  alien  smuggling   offense . . . engages in conduct that    consciously or recklessly places another in serious danger    of death or serious bodily injury." H. R. CONF. REP. No.  104-863, at 580 (1996). A comparison of the House Conference Report  with the final version of demonstrates that Congress intended courts to require a less  stringent causal nexus between the defendant's actions and the  substantial risk facing the aliens than that proposed by Garcia. The  court can glean from the Report that the defendant does not have to  manufacture the dangerous condition. Rather, Garcia engaged in  conduct that placed the aliens in substantial risk of death or  serious bodily injury for enhancement purposes when he transported  aliens through the hot South Texas brush in the heat of the summer  with inadequate water and food.
