KING, Chief Judge:

On  September 18, 2001, Defendant Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero ("Garcia")  pled guilty without a plea agreement to three counts of knowingly  and recklessly transporting an undocumented alien for purposes of  financial gain in violation of .  On January 2, 2002, the    district court sentenced Garcia to forty-eight months of  imprisonment on each count (to run concurrently).

Garcia appeals both enhancements. On appeal, the discrete issues  before the court are thus whether the district court erred in  enhancing Garcia's base offense level under and under .  We find no error.
