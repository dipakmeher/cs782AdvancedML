.  As found by the district court, when Garcia "stepped up to the  plate and said I will guide you through the hot South Texas desert  in the dead of summer," he placed these individuals in a  substantially risky situation within the meaning of the guideline.  Although Garcia had no control over the conditions, he was  responsible     and was to receive compensation for     guiding these individuals and thus "created" the  substantial risk within the meaning of the guideline in the same way  the defendants in Cuyler were responsible for "creating" the substantial risk  there.
