While this court has not addressed whether intent is required for an enhancement under, case law from the Ninth Circuit is again instructional. In Herrera, the court of appeals addressed. The Herrera court found that no intent requirement is necessary for an enhancement under this subsection, stating that, 

Section (b)(5), immediately preceding § (b)(6), specifies that intent or recklessness is required to hold a defendant responsible for creating the risk of death. Section (b)(6)(4) states simply that if death results, an increase is required. The failure to specify that intent is required, immediately following a section that specifies intent, is a clear indication that no intent is necessary for an increase under § (b)(6).

Id. (emphasis in original). The Herrera court's analysis of intent is persuasive. Plainly, Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero does not have to intend the death of Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez for the enhancement to apply because the guideline does not require it.
