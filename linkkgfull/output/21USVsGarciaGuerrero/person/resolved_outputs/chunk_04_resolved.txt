The district court enhanced Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero's base offense level for recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person while transporting unlawful aliens into the United States from a base offense level of fifteen to a base offense level of eighteen. It found that while Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero did not "create" the sun and desert, the trafficking of illegal aliens across South Texas to avoid detection requires moving the aliens in "odd ways for the very purpose of committing this crime," and that "taking these risks" increases the successfulness of the offense and ultimately creates "a situation just asking for a disaster." The district court then enhanced Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero's base offense level eight levels for the death of Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez.
