Reckless conduct to which the adjustment from subsection (b)(5) applies includes a wide variety of conduct (e.g., transporting persons in the trunk or engine compartment of a motor vehicle, carrying substantially more passengers than the rated capacity of a motor vehicle or vessel, or harboring persons in a crowded, dangerous, or inhumane condition . . . .)

Id. at cmt. 6.

This court recently addressed. In, this court affirmed the district court's application of the reckless endangerment enhancement where the defendant pled guilty to transporting undocumented aliens in his extended cab pickup truck for financial gain. There, seven aliens were found riding in the cab of the truck and four aliens were found lying down in the bed of the pickup truck. This conduct was found to constitute "reckless conduct" for purposes of the enhancement even though it was not specified in the commentary to the guideline. Thus, while Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero is correct that the commentary does not expressly state that guiding a group of aliens through the South Texas desert-like brush in June is "reckless conduct" to which the adjustment applies, this argument was squarely rejected by this court in Cuyler.
