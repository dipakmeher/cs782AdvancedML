On June 4, 2001, Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero approached a group of nine undocumented aliens in San Luis, Potosi, Mexico, and informed them that he was their guide into the United States (to San Antonio). After taking a bus to Nuevo Laredo and purchasing a medium bottle of water and two cans of food each, Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero, Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez, Jaime Gomez-Arroyo, and seven other undocumented aliens took canoes across the Rio Grande River. They entered the United States at approximately 6:00 a.m. on July 5, 2001. Once here, Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero walked the group through the brush from early morning until midnight at intervals of four-to-five hours with twenty-minute rest periods in between the intervals. The following day, Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero commenced the walking ritual at approximately 7:00 a.m. At approximately 11:00 a.m., Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez, a member of the group, became too ill to continue the trek with the group. Her uncle, Jaime Gomez-Arroyo, remained behind with her while the other members of the group continued the journey. At some point that afternoon, Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez fell asleep and stopped breathing. Jaime Gomez-Arroyo sought help from a nearby ranch hand.
