He is argued to not have engaged in reckless conduct similar to that listed in the guideline commentary. Garcia also provided inaccurate advice on journey length and was found by the district court to have placed individuals in a substantially risky situation. The district court found that he recklessly created a substantial risk of death. He represented to the group that the journey would be only one day.",
