In the late afternoon on June 6, 2001, United States Border Patrol agents from the Laredo South Station were notified by the ranch hand that an undocumented female alien was in apparent distress at the La Moca Ranch. When agents and emergency technicians arrived at the ranch, they found the body of Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez. As indicated by the PSR, the autopsy found the sole cause of her death to be "probable heat stroke."

The United States District Court Border Patrol agents met with Jaime Gomez-Arroyo. In a search of the surrounding area, they found the other members of the group, which consisted of seven additional undocumented aliens and Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero. Two of the aliens in the group needed medical attention, and, according to the probation officer at sentencing, were in the hospital for two weeks recovering from their injuries.

In a sworn statement to a the United States District Court Border Patrol agent, Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero stated that he was the only guide for the group, that he was guiding the group to San Antonio for financial gain ($400 per alien), and that he had transported aliens through South Texas on two prior occasions in the extended cab pickup truck.
