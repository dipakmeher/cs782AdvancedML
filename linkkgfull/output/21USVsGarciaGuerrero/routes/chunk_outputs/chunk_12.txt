As stated, the guideline itself uses the phrase "creating a substantial risk." (2001) (emphasis added). However, Congress, through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 566 ("IIRIRA"), directed the Sentencing Commission to allow for the imposition of "an appropriate sentencing enhancement on a defendant who, in the course of committing an alien smuggling offense . . . engages in conduct that consciously or recklessly places another in serious danger of death or serious bodily injury." House Conference Report No. 104-863, at 580 (1996). A comparison of the House Conference Report with the final version of demonstrates that United States to require a less stringent causal nexus between the defendant's actions and the substantial risk facing the aliens than that proposed by Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero. United States can glean from the House Conference Report that the defendant does not have to manufacture the dangerous condition. Rather, Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero engaged in conduct that placed the aliens in substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury for enhancement purposes when he transported aliens through the hot South Texas desert in the heat of the summer with inadequate water and food.

Finally, Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero argues that the enhancement under is erroneous because he did not possess the requisite subjective intent. This argument was not raised until oral argument in United States, and will not be addressed.
