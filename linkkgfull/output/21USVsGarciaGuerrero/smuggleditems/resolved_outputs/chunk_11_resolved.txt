As found by the United States, when Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero "stepped up to the plate and said I will guide you through South Texas Trek," he placed nineteen undocumented aliens in a substantially risky situation within the meaning of the United States. Although Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero had no control over the conditions, he was responsible and was to receive compensation for guiding nineteen undocumented aliens and thus "created" the substantial risk within the meaning of the United States in the same way the alien smuggler guides in Cuyler were responsible for "creating" the substantial risk there.
