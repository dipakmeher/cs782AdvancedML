As stated, the guideline itself uses the phrase "creating a substantial risk." (2001) (emphasis added). However, United States Congress, through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 566 ("IIRIRA"), directed the United States Sentencing Commission to allow for the imposition of "an appropriate sentencing enhancement on a defendant who, in the course of committing an alien smuggling offense . . . engages in conduct that consciously or recklessly places another in serious danger of death or serious bodily injury." House Conference Report No. 104-863, at 580 (1996). A comparison of the House Conference Report No. 104-863 with the final version of demonstrates that the United States requires a less stringent causal nexus between the defendant's actions and the substantial risk facing the nineteen undocumented aliens than that proposed by Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero. The United States can glean from the House Conference Report No. 104-863 that the defendant does not have to manufacture the dangerous condition. Rather, Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero engaged in conduct that placed the nineteen undocumented aliens in substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury for enhancement purposes when he transported nineteen undocumented aliens through South Texas Trek in the heat of the summer with inadequate water and food.
