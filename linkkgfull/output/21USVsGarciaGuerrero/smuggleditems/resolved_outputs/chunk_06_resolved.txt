Reckless conduct to which the adjustment from subsection (b)(5) applies includes a wide variety of conduct (e.g., transporting persons in the trunk or engine compartment of a motor vehicle, carrying substantially more passengers than the rated capacity of a motor vehicle or vessel, or harboring persons in a crowded, dangerous, or inhumane condition . . . .)

Id. at cmt. 6.

This Court of Appeals recently addressed. In, United States affirmed the United States District Court's application of the reckless endangerment enhancement where the defendant pled guilty to transporting nineteen undocumented aliens in his the extended cab pickup truck for financial gain. There, seven other undocumented aliens were found riding in the cab of the the extended cab pickup truck and twelve of the nineteen undocumented aliens were found lying down in the bed of the the extended cab pickup truck. This conduct was found to constitute "reckless conduct" for purposes of the enhancement even though it was not specified in the commentary to the United States Guidelines Manual. Thus, while Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero is correct that the commentary does not expressly state that guiding nineteen undocumented aliens through South Texas Trek in June is "reckless conduct" to which the adjustment applies, this argument was squarely rejected by United States Government in Cuyler.
