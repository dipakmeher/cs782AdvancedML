In this factually similar case, we too are persuaded to extend to the conduct at issue. We look at the entire picture. Here, the PSR indicates that the temperature on June 5, 2001 reached 100 degrees and the temperature on June 6, 2001 reached 105 degrees. Each of the nineteen undocumented aliens had only one bottle of water (which was depleted six hours after the journey began) and two cans of food, and several nineteen undocumented aliens told United States Border Patrol agents that they would have bought more water and food had Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero accurately advised them of the length of the journey. The nineteen undocumented aliens requested, and were denied, longer rest periods. The fact that one member of the group, Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez, died from "probable heat stroke" and two others required rather extensive hospitalization at Laredo South Station underscores the dangerous nature of the South Texas Trek. We agree with United States Government that the conduct is covered by (1) Causation.
