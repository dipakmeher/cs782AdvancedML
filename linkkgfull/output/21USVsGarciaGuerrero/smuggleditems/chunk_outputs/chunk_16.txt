CONCLUSION

The United States District Court did not err in enhancing Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero's sentence under and under. The sentence is AFFIRMED.

End of Document

1. He also imposed a three-year term of supervised release for each count (to run concurrently) and imposed a special assessment fee of $300. No fine was imposed.

2. Members of the group told agents that Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero represented to them that the length of the South Texas Journey through South Texas would be only one day and that had they been aware of the actual length of the South Texas Journey, they would have purchased adequate provisions for themselves in Nuevo Laredo. Although Inocencio Garcia-Guerrero initially told agents that he represented to the aliens that the journey would be three days, in his appellate brief, he admits representing the length of the South Texas Journey to be one full day through South Texas.

3. As reflected in the record, the autopsy report describes Alma Delia Simon-Fernandez as a 142-pound, normally developed and adequately nourished adult female.
