20 Although Agent Benavides did not recall having any conversation en route to the Border Patrol station, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. testified that, on the way to the United States Border Patrol station, Agent Benavides "was asking him a lot of questions," using "bad language" and "bad words" and talking "very rude." (May 3rd Hr'g at 2:44, 3:27-3:28 p.m.). According to Defendant, Agent Benavides informed him that he was "screwed big time . . . and that the guys in the white car already said everything about him, and he better start talking, and if not, he was going to jail." (Id. at 3:28 p.m.). IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. then testified that he did not know why Agent Benavides was asking him to go the United States Border Patrol station; that "he didn't know what was going on or anything;" that he did not know who was in the white vehicle; that he "did not know how many white cars there were;" that he "did not know whose white car it was . . . I mean, there's plenty of white cars and black cars, all different colors;" and that he "did not know if they were talking about the same vehicle or not," because Agent Benavides "didn't specify." (Id. at 3:37-3:38 p.m.). IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. also retracted the statement he had given on the stand ten minutes previously that "the guys in the white car already said everything about him" and "screwed him big time," testifying instead that Agent Benavides said only "that they had a white car," to which Defendant responded, "well I don't know what you're talking about." (Id. at 3:37 p.m.). Moments after that, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. appeared to again change his testimony, stating that Agent Benavides "said all these bad words to him," but had said nothing about a white car. (Id. at 3:38-3:39 p.m.).
