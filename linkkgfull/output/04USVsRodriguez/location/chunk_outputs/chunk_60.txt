23  Although  the white vehicle was registered to Dallas-Fort Worth, Defendant  IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. actually rented the vehicle at the Laredo  International Airport. (May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Ex. 10). Defendant  RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. elicited testimony from SANTIAGO HINOJOSA, a  manager with the Hertz rental car company at the Laredo  International Airport, that it was "not unusual" to rent a  car from one location that is registered to another city or state.  (May 2nd Hr'g at 1:46 p.m.). Cars currently at the Laredo airport  location are registered to "New York, . . . Florida,  Louisiana," as their registration "depends on where the  company purchased them." ( Id. ).  In essence, a rental vehicle's registration does not necessarily  coincide with where the location the car was in fact rented from.  ( Id. at 1:47 p.m.). Although JORGE LUIS TREVIÑO testified on cross examination  that he knew Hertz has "rental car places all over," ( id. at 3:32 p.m.), he was not asked whether he was aware that vehicles  rented out of one location are registered to distant locations.  Based on JORGE LUIS TREVIÑO's recurrent testimony that the white sedan  was out of "Dallas, Texas," it seems logical to infer that  he was proceeding under the rational impression that the rental  vehicle registered to Dallas-Fort Worth was in fact rented from the  Dallas area.
