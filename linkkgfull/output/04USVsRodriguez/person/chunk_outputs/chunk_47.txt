1  During  the hearing, Defendant Ricardo Rodriguez appeared to concede the  fact that the route would be a convenient route for smugglers to  take, as evidenced by the following statements by his counsel during  the cross examination of Agent Trevino: ". . . what a smuggler  wants to do . . . is drive up U.S. 59, make this turn onto FM  2050, and then hope you guys don't pay any attention to him. . . .  And if you don't, then his chances of getting caught are very slim  at that point. . . . The only way is if he just happens to run into  a roving . . . Border Patrolman or gets pulled over by a policeman .  . . ." (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:58-2:59 p.m.). Defendant also  suggested that "since you can drive down to San Pablo Road,  and then drive over to Highway 16, and then drive up Highway 16,  there's no reason to drop anybody off . . . ." ( Id. at 2:59 p.m.). He also noted that, from Highway 16, "you can  work your way over to a major highway going north." ( Id. at 2:33 p.m.). "That's the reason why smugglers want to get on  16, because once you get on 16, you're . . . kind of home free in a  way; you don't have any more checkpoints." ( Id. ).
