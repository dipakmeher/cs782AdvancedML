About  "a mile and a half south of the wind farm," past San Pablo  Road, Agent Trevino initiated a stop of the white vehicle because of  "all of those facts together." ( Id. at 3:00 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:09, 1:11 p.m.). As he activated his  overhead lights, the vehicle once again "went just a little bit  off the road," just as it had several times before. (May 2nd  Hr'g at 2:25 p.m.). Once the vehicle was stopped, Agent Trevino  "approached the vehicle and identified himself as a Border  Patrol Agent." ( Id. at 2:24-2:25 p.m.). The driver of the vehicle, Ricardo Rodriguez,  informed Agent Trevino that he was a United States citizen. ( Id. at 2:25 p.m.). When he inquired into the citizenship of the  passengers, "they first did    not acknowledge him" and continued to "look straight,"  but ultimately "acknowledged they were all Mexicans." ( Id. at 2:25-2:26 p.m.). Agent Trevino "counted how many were in the  vehicle" and then asked if anyone else was in the vehicle, to  which Ricardo Rodriguez responded that there were "two more"  in the trunk. ( Id. at 2:26 p.m.). The trunk passengers also "admitted" that  they were in the country illegally. ( Id. at 2:26-2:27 p.m.). Once Agent Trevino realized that the white sedan  was "transporting illegals," he put information over the  Border Patrol radio "to be on the lookout" for the black  Dodge truck, which had "passed him going southbound on FM  2050" during the stop of the white sedan, since he "believed  that both of them were connected" "because the two  vehicles were out of Dallas" 14 and because "both the vehicles were riding in tandem south on  FM 2050." (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:27-2:28, 3:23-3:25 p.m.).
