Of  course the inquiry cannot end here, as Defendant also contends that  he was subject to an "unlawful arrest" because there was  no probable cause to arrest him. As indicated above, Agent Benavides  arrived at the scene of the traffic stop as Officer Reyes was  issuing the citation. He approached Ignacio Rodriguez, presented  himself as a Border Patrol agent, and inquired into Defendant's  citizenship and travel plans as "routine questions." Agent  Benavides then awaited the results of the canine search before  informing Ignacio Rodriguez "that he needed to go with him  to the checkpoint for further questioning, and that he was going  to transport him to the checkpoint." The testimony made  explicit that Agent Benavides "didn't give Defendant the  option" to leave, but rather "just told Defendant that  'you're going to come to the checkpoint for further questioning,'  whereby Ignacio Rodriguez "agreed to come . . . ." Agent  Benavides then escorted Defendant into the back seat of his vehicle  and drove to the checkpoint eighteen miles away, placing Defendant  inside the checkpoint, in "an open area" with other agents  nearby, sometime between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. Agent Benavides never  informed    Ignacio Rodriguez that he was under arrest and no handcuffs were  used. At some point, however, Defendant was placed "in a  holding cell," behind a locked sliding door, and remained there  until Agent Montemayor interviewed him around 11:30 p.m.
