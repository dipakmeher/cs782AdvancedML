21  The  undersigned does not consider the fact that the vehicle was "riding  low" to contribute to the reasonable suspicion for the stop. As  indicated during cross examination, the vehicle had five passengers,  which was not more "than the rate of capacity in the passenger  compartment." (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:05 p.m.). Agent Trevino had no  reason to believe that there was anybody in the trunk as he  approached the car, and presumed it was "riding low because  there were five people in it," and for no other reason. ( Id. at 3:06-3:07 p.m.).
