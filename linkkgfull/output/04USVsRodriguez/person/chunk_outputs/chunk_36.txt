In  the instant case, Officer Reyes approached Ignacio Rodriguez, "told  him who he was, what the reason for the stop was, asked him for  his driver's license and proof of insurance." At that point,  Officer Reyes could see that "he was shaking, his hand was  shaking a lot, and he . . . seemed extremely nervous, a little too  nervous." Although Defendant provided his driver's license, he  was unable to provide proof of insurance, so Defendant "went  around to the passenger side" to "look through the  glove box" for it. After the search for proof of insurance for  the vehicle came up fruitless, because of Defendant's extreme  nervousness, Officer Reyes asked "if he had any  contraband"    in the vehicle. Although Ignacio Rodriguez denied possessing  contraband, he nonetheless gave Officer Reyes his consent to search  the vehicle. 28 Although courts have recognized that "a detention may be of  excessively long duration even though the officers have not  completed and continue to pursue investigation of the matters  justifying the stop's initiation," ,  the testimony given in this case indicates that within minutes of  the initial contact, even before Officer Reyes received the results  of the computer check, Defendant had consented to the search of his  vehicle. See  id. ("Because the officers were still waiting for the computer  check at the time that they received consent to search the car, the  detention to that point continued to be supported by the facts that  justified its initiation."). Upon receiving consent, Officer  Reyes informed Defendant to "just hold on" while he  contacted dispatch to "have somebody come" to conduct the  search.
