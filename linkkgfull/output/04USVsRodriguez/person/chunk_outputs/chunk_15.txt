When  dispatch soon thereafter advised Officer Reyes that the "owner  of the vehicle was a female, he asked Ignacio whose vehicle it  was, and he said it was his aunt's vehicle." (May 2nd Hr'g at  3:41, 3:54 p.m.). Officer Reyes also inquired into Ignacio  Rodriguez's travel plans, and he stated that he was "coming  from Laredo, and he was going to Dallas, Texas," a statement  which raised Officer Reyes's suspicions, because "from Laredo  to Dallas, the best route is 1-35, and he was . . . taking 16  towards San  Antonio ."  ( Id. at 3:41-3:42 p.m.). Officer Reyes again asked about the owner of the  truck, and Ignacio Rodriguez "changed that it was from his aunt  to that it belonged to his cousin." ( Id. at 3:43 p.m.). All of Officer Reyes's questions came prior to his  issuing the citation. ( Id. at 4:04 p.m.). Because Ignacio Rodriguez "couldn't provide  any insurance information,  as soon as . . . Officer Reyes  couldn't determine who the owner of the vehicle was, . . . it was at  that point that he didn't know if the vehicle was possibly  stolen" 16 and therefore    decided to impound the vehicle. 17 ( Id. at 3:43-3:44 p.m.). The decision to impound the vehicle was made "at  the moment that Officer Reyes was writing the ticket," which  was "approximately five minutes" after Officer Reyes had  made contact with Ignacio Rodriguez. ( Id. at 3:46, 3:59 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:44-3:45 p.m.). Officer Reyes  finished writing the citation after another three to five minutes  and then returned Defendant's driver's license. (May 2nd Hr'g at  3:56, 4:05 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:24 p.m.). Although he "was  going to let Ignacio Rodriguez go," 18 Officer Reyes testified that he "wasn't going to allow the  vehicle to continue to its destination." (May 2nd Hr'g at 4:05  p.m.).
