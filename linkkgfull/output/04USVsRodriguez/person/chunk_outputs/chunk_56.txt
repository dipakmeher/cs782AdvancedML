22  Defendant  introduced into evidence "district traffic maps" of FM  2050 and U.S. 59, prepared by the Texas Department of  Transportation, which indicate traffic flow data "primarily  collected and determined by . . . the Transportation, Planning, and  Programming Division in Austin." (May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 6-9;  May 2nd Hr'g at 1:30-1:31 p.m.). Alberto Ramirez, Director of  Transportation, Planning and Development for the Texas Department of  Transportation, Laredo Division, was unable to verify the accuracy  of the data or inform the Court "the mechanism by which TxDOT  determines" the traffic flow data, but did state that "it  was his understanding that the data indicated . . . the average  daily traffic" on FM 2050 and U.S. 59. (May 2nd Hr'g at 1:29,  1:31-1:33, 1:36-1:37 p.m.). The maps further indicate that they are  from 2011. ( Id. at 1:39-1:40 p.m.). Despite the potential relevance of these maps,  the undersigned is unable to afford them much weight. Defendant did  not provide any indication as to how the "average daily  traffic" data is determined, nor could he attest to their  accuracy. Further, there is no way of knowing whether the traffic  data gathered from 2011 is at all indicative of the traffic patterns  in 2013. Most significantly, Agent Trevino focused his testimony on  the type of vehicles traveling on FM 2050, not the number of vehicles traveling that road. The average daily traffic data  provided to the Court suggests nothing about the type of vehicles or the direction of the vehicles on FM 2050, and is therefore of limited, if any,  value to the present analysis. The undersigned must therefore defer  to the testimony of Agent Trevino regarding the usual traffic  patterns on FM 2050, since he has worked at the Freer checkpoint  "two or three days out of the week" since August of 2011.  ( Id. at 2:07, 2:17 p.m.)
