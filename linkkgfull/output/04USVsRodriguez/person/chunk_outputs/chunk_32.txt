"The seeks to prevent arbitrary police action, not to require  absolute    certainty before law enforcement officers may investigate," ,  and thus "the reasonable suspicion standard clearly does not  require an agent to 'eliminate all reasonable possibility of  innocent travel before conducting an investigatory stop."  (per curiam) (quoting ).  The majority of the Brignoni-Ponce  factors ,  as scrutinized above, all contributed to the reasonable suspicion  that Defendant's vehicle was involved in illegal activities. See (per curiam) (finding the "district court properly relied, in  part, upon the following facts in concluding that there was  reasonable suspicion: the defendant was traveling on Highway 85, a  common smuggling route that avoids immigration checkpoints, shortly  after midnight; the agent did not recognize the vehicle as a local  vehicle; and the registration check on the defendant's vehicle  revealed that it was registered near Dallas."); (per curiam) (concluding reasonable suspicion existed, based in  large part on: "the area in which the stop took place was known  for illegal activity; the Agent saw two vehicles traveling in  tandem, and his experience taught him that vehicles engaged in  smuggling almost always travel in tandem while other vehicles    in the area almost never do; and the Agent, familiar with the area  and its usual traffic, did not recognize either of the two  vehicles"); ("Viewing the evidence as a collective whole through the lens  of the officers,  finding the following factors provided the  reasonable suspicion necessary to stop the defendant's pickup: (1)  his proximity to the border (35 miles); (2) his proximity to a  drug cache (2 miles); (3) his use of a known drug smuggling route  (U.S. Highway 385) in an area known for drug smuggling (Big Bend);  and (4) his behavior upon sign of the marked patrol car (he  appeared stiff, stared straight ahead, failed to acknowledge the  agent, and slowed down considerably).").
