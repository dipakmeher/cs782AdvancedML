As  noted above, Defendant Ricardo Rodriguez    challenges the stop of his white sedan by United States Border  Patrol Agent Trevino, arguing that "the factors known to  Agent Trevino at the time of the stop of Mr. Rodriguez's vehicle  fall short of reasonable suspicion as required by the ."  (Dkt. No. 35, at 3). Ricardo Rodriguez therefore moves to suppress  the evidence resulting from said stop. ( Id. ).  Defendant Ignacio Rodriguez instead challenges the traffic stop  performed by Officer Reyes of the Freer Police Department, claiming  "that the stop was illegal or a pretextual stop" and  that "Officer Reyes overstepped the scope of the stop and the  nature of the interrogation that comes with a traffic stop,"  asserting that "all statements obtained by the Government  should be suppressed along with any evidence obtained therefrom."  (Dkt. No. 39, at 2). Ignacio Rodriguez also claims that, while he  "was in Government 'custody and control,' agents of the  Government obtained written and oral statements from him in  violation of his right to counsel" because of the fact that  there was no "probable cause to arrest him . . . ." ( Id. ).  Although "a defendant normally bears the burden of proving by  a preponderance of the evidence that the challenged search or  seizure was unconstitutional,"     ,  "when the government searches or seizes a defendant without a  warrant, the government bears the burden of proving, by a  preponderance of the evidence, that the search or seizure was  constitutional." .  Therefore, in the instant case, because both Defendants were seized  without a warrant, the government bears the burden of proving that  the stops were constitutional. Because of the distinct analysis  required for each of the Defendants' motions to suppress, the  undersigned will address each in turn. Whether United States Border  Patrol Agent Luis Trevino had reasonable suspicion to stop Ricardo  Rodriguez's vehicle is the first issue to be addressed.
