(per curiam) (quoting .  Smugglers can instead use a "load car-scout car"  arrangement, "in which the load car carries the drugs and the  scout car travels behind it to inform the owners of the drugs if  anything happens to the load car, and to distract the police if the  need arises." .

4  The  testimony described Farm-to-Market Road 2050 as a paved road with  only two lanes, one in each direction. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:35-2:36  p.m.; see May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Ex. 12). Agent Trevino also testified that  "there's no shoulder" on FM 2050, so any vehicle straying  from the lane "will pick up rocks and dust." (May 2nd Hr'g  at 2:22, 2:35 p.m.). The Court therefore interprets Jorge Luis Trevino's  statements that the vehicles went "off the shoulder" to be  interchangeable with the statements that the vehicles went "off  the road."
