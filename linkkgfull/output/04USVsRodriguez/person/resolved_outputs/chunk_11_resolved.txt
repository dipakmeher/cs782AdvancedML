During the cross examination of Agent Trevino, a more detailed description of FM 2050 and its surroundings was elicited. Mills Bennett Road is a "dirt road" which, "probably about five miles, six miles, south of the checkpoint," intersects FM 2050 and travels eastward. (Id. at 2:34, 2:36 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:06 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 1, 12). The entrance and office of the aforementioned wind farm is on the west side of FM 2050 "between twelve and fifteen miles" from the checkpoint on U.S. 59. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:39 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 14-16). The windmills themselves extend out to the west of FM 2050 across various ranches. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:43 p.m.). San Pablo Road is south of, but "really close to, the wind farm," and is "another road that goes to the east off of FM 2050." (Id. at 2:41-2:42 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 17-18). Also "right around" and slightly south of the wind farm is the "Moglia" ranch house, as well as the "Stag" ranch trailer. 13 (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:45-2:46 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g. Def. Exs. 19-20). Farther south down FM 2050 is "Santo Nino Road, also known as Dinn Ranch," which also extends to the east. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:47 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 1, 21). Both San Pablo Road and Santo Nino Road extend to Highway 16, providing vehicle access the entire way. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:51-2:52 p.m.).
