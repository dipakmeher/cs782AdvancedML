17  Reymundo Reyes further testified that it was within his rights to impound the  vehicle for lack of proof of insurance, and that it was a decision  within an "officer's discretion." (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:44,  3:57 p.m.). He has impounded between "eight to ten"  vehicles since the beginning of the year because of "no  driver's license, no insurance, . . . or expired registration."

18  Reymundo Reyes indicated that IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "could have called a  family member to come and pick him up" from the nearby gas  station, and that he did not otherwise tell IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. he had to  "stay around." (May 2nd Hr'g at 4:05 p.m.). IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR., on the other hand, testified that he did not feel free to  leave even after he was handed his citation because "he asked  the Freer patrolman, . . . what time what buses come over so he  could leave, and Reymundo Reyes said he didn't know," but  that IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "needed to wait" for the Border  Patrol agents to arrive. (May 3rd Hr'g at 3:24, 3:27 p.m.).
