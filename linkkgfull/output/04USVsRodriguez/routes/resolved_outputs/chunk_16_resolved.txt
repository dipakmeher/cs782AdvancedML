When dispatch soon thereafter advised Reymundo Reyes that the "owner of the vehicle was a female, he asked IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. whose vehicle it was, and he said it was his aunt's vehicle." (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:41, 3:54 p.m.). Reymundo Reyes also inquired into IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s travel plans, and he stated that he was "coming from Laredo, Texas, and he was going to Dallas, Texas," a statement which raised Reymundo Reyes's suspicions, because "from Laredo, Texas to Dallas, Texas, the best route is Highway 35, and he was . . . taking Highway 16 towards San Antonio." (Id. at 3:41-3:42 p.m.). Reymundo Reyes again asked about the owner of the truck, and IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "changed that it was from his aunt to that it belonged to his cousin." (Id. at 3:43 p.m.). All of Reymundo Reyes's questions came prior to his issuing the citation. (Id. at 4:04 p.m.). Because IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "couldn't provide any insurance information, as soon as . . . Reymundo Reyes couldn't determine who the owner of the vehicle was, . . . it was at that point that he didn't know if the vehicle was possibly stolen" and therefore decided to impound the vehicle. (Id. at 3:43-3:44 p.m.). The decision to impound the vehicle was made "at the moment that Reymundo Reyes was writing the ticket," which was "approximately five minutes" after Reymundo Reyes had made contact with IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. (Id. at 3:46, 3:59 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:44-3:45 p.m.). Reymundo Reyes finished writing the citation after another three to five minutes and then returned the Defendant's driver's license. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:56, 4:05 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:24 p.m.). Although he "was going to let IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. go," Reymundo Reyes testified that he "wasn't going to allow the vehicle to continue to its destination." (May 2nd Hr'g at 4:05 p.m.).
