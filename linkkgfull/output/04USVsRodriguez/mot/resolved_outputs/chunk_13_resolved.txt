About a mile and a half south of the wind farm on Farm-to-Market Road 2050, past San Pablo Road, Agent Trevino initiated a stop of the white Malibu sedan because of all of those facts together. (Id. at 3:00 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:09, 1:11 p.m.). As he activated his overhead lights, the vehicle once again went just a little bit off Farm-to-Market Road 2050, just as it had several times before. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:25 p.m.). Once the white Malibu sedan was stopped, Agent Trevino approached the white Malibu sedan and identified himself as a United States Border Patrol Agent. (Id. at 2:24-2:25 p.m.). The driver of the white Malibu sedan, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR., informed Jorge Luis Trevino that he was a United States citizen. (Id. at 2:25 p.m.). When he inquired into the citizenship of the passengers, they first did not acknowledge him and continued to look straight, but ultimately acknowledged they were all Mexicans. (Id. at 2:25-2:26 p.m.). Jorge Luis Trevino counted how many were in the white Malibu sedan and then asked if anyone else was in the white Malibu sedan, to which RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. responded that there were two more in the trunk. (Id. at 2:26 p.m.). The trunk passengers also admitted that they were in the country illegally. (Id. at 2:26-2:27 p.m.). Once Jorge Luis Trevino realized that the white Malibu sedan was transporting illegals, he put information over the United States Border Patrol radio to be on the lookout for the black Dodge truck, which had passed him going southbound on Farm-to-Market Road 2050 during the stop of the white Malibu sedan, since he believed that both of them were connected because the two vehicles were out of Dallas, Texas and because both the vehicles were riding in tandem south on Farm-to-Market Road 2050. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:27-2:28, 3:23-3:25 p.m.).
