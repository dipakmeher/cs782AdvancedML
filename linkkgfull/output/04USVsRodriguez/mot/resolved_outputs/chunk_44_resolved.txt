Although the Fifth Circuit has addressed similar cases, courts in other circuits have delineated a concise standard with which to analyze such cases. "Sufficient evidence that two vehicles are driving in tandem plus evidence that one vehicle contains contraband can provide probable cause sufficient to support arresting the driver of the other vehicle." Compare (determining there was "considerable objective evidence" that two vehicles, white Malibu sedan and black Dodge truck, were driving in tandem when both were "a mere two car lengths apart on an Interstate highway in very light traffic during the predawn hours of the morning" and the first car to be pulled over "seemingly waited for the other car to elude the officer's range of vision before pulling over"), and (concluding that the "sequentially numbered, out-of-state specialty license plates" on two vehicles, white Malibu sedan and black Dodge truck, traveling in tandem indicated a sufficient connection between the cars to arrest the driver of the second vehicle after determining the first vehicle contained "a false compartment beneath the floor") with (finding "insufficient facts to demonstrate that the pickup truck, black Dodge pickup truck, was driving in tandem with the Cadillac" when the facts indicated only that "both vehicles had Arizona plates and both were heading toward Arizona on an Interstate highway," with the court noting that "this is not an instance where two vehicles were traveling on a seldom-used remote road, such as an Interstate highway, to avoid detection").
