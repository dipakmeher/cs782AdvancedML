22  IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. introduced into evidence "district traffic maps" of Farm-to-Market Road 2050 and U.S. 59, prepared by the Texas Department of Transportation, which indicate traffic flow data "primarily collected and determined by . . . the Transportation, Planning, and Programming Division in Austin, Texas." (May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 6-9; May 2nd Hr'g at 1:30-1:31 p.m.). Alberto Ramirez, Director of Transportation, Planning and Development for the Texas Department of Transportation, Laredo Division, was unable to verify the accuracy of the data or inform the Court "the mechanism by which TxDOT determines" the traffic flow data, but did state that "it was his understanding that the data indicated . . . the average daily traffic" on Farm-to-Market Road 2050 and U.S. 59. (May 2nd Hr'g at 1:29, 1:31-1:33, 1:36-1:37 p.m.). The maps further indicate that they are from 2011. ( Id. at 1:39-1:40 p.m.). Despite the potential relevance of these maps, the undersigned is unable to afford them much weight. IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle was not mentioned in this context, but he did not provide any indication as to how the "average daily traffic" data is determined, nor could he attest to their accuracy. Further, there is no way of knowing whether the traffic data gathered from 2011 is at all indicative of the traffic patterns in 2013. Most significantly, Jorge Luis Trevino focused his testimony on the type of vehicles traveling on Farm-to-Market Road 2050, not the number of vehicles traveling that road. The average daily traffic data provided to the Court suggests nothing about the type of vehicles or the direction of the vehicles on Farm-to-Market Road 2050, and is therefore of limited, if any, value to the present analysis. J. Scott Hacker must therefore defer to the testimony of Jorge Luis Trevino regarding the usual traffic patterns on Farm-to-Market Road 2050, since he has worked at the Freer immigration checkpoint "two or three days out of the week" since August of 2011.
