After Agent Rodriguez alerted to the two vehicles, Agent Trevino decided to go look into the vehicles, because lately the United States Border Patrol agents have noticed "a lot of drop-offs on Farm-to-Market Road 2050," where "vehicles with illegals . . . drop the illegal aliens off . .    . between the Freer immigration checkpoint and Bruni" so that the aliens can "then . . . walk east from Farm-to-Market Road 2050 all the way to Highway 16, and then they get picked up somewhere along Highway 16, and . . . go to Houston or San Antonio." (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:09 p.m.). These drop-offs are done "to avoid the two checkpoints," the Freer immigration checkpoint on Highway 59 and the Hebbronville checkpoint on Highway 359. (Id. at 2:12 p.m.). A person could also drive "the loop" without encountering a checkpoint, because although Farm-to-Market Road 2050 intersects Highway 59 to the west of Freer immigration checkpoint, Farm-to-Market Road 2050 intersects Highway 359 to the east of the Hebbronville checkpoint, such that "if someone were to want to avoid checkpoints, they would go Highway 59, south down Farm-to-Market Road 2050, and then over to Highway 359," which thereafter connects with Highway 16, allowing access to Houston or San Antonio to the north. (Id. at 2:12-2:13, 2:33, 2:58-2:59 p.m.).
