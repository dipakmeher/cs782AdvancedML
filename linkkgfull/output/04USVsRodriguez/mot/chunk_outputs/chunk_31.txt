Agent Jorge Luis Trevino explained that, in addition to the fact that the vehicles were driving in tandem, both vehicles were "going on and off Farm-to-Market Road 2050," "picking up rocks and dust," which "made him believe that the drivers were nervous because he was behind them." 27 Previous courts have noted that "when an officer's actions are such that any driver, whether innocent or guilty, would be preoccupied with his presence, then any inference that might be drawn from the driver's behavior is destroyed." ; see (stating that it was "not clear whether the defendant swerved when the patrol car approached him to read his license plate, hardly suspicious, or if he swerved after the patrol car dropped back, which could reinforce the officers' suspicions about a driver's level of nervousness.") cf. (determining that the defendant's "deceleration and swerving on such a road at nighttime, in response to a rapidly accelerating vehicle with its high-beams on, weighs, at best, only slightly in favor of the reasonableness" of the stop). Here, Agent Jorge Luis Trevino followed the black truck for "about five minutes" and the white sedan "for a little while" after running each of their plates, (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:10 p.m.), all the while observing the vehicles repeatedly "going on and off Farm-to-Market Road 2050." Such behavior by RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. and IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR., by driving in tandem and running off Farm-to-Market Road 2050, adds to the reasonableness of Agent Jorge Luis Trevino's suspicions. See (agreeing that "the fact that the vehicle . . . began weaving shortly after the agents began following it . . . , which indicated the driver was watching the agents in his rear-view mirror," added to the reasonable suspicion that the driver was involved in the transportation of undocumented persons).
