Shortly thereafter dispatch advised Officer Reyes that the 'owner of the black Dodge pickup truck was a female,' and so he asked IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. 'whose black Dodge pickup truck it was, and he said it was his aunt's black Dodge pickup truck.' Defendant then stated that it 'belonged to his cousin' instead. Officer Reyes therefore inquired into IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s travel plans, and he stated that he was 'coming from Laredo, Texas, and he was going to Dallas, Texas,' a statement which raised Officer Reyes's suspicions because of the route being driven. All of Officer Reyes's questions came prior to his issuing the citation, and fall within the ambit of what is permissible under the law, as the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals 'has consistently approved a law enforcement officer's questioning a driver's travel plans where the driver was not the authorized vehicle lessee or otherwise appeared to lack driving authority.' (stating also that a law enforcement officer may also ask about the purpose and itinerary of a driver's trip during the traffic stop.) These questions 'may efficiently determine whether a traffic violation has taken place, and if so, whether a citation or warning should be issued or an arrest made.' Id. Here, significantly, 'the questioning did nothing to extend the duration of the initial, valid seizure.'
