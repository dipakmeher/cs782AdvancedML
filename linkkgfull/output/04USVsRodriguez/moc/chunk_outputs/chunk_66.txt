24  United States Border Patrol Agent Trevino also testified that the black Dodge pickup truck had a 'dark blue or black' camper. As noted before, this testimony went uncorroborated by Freer Police Department Officer Reyes and United States Border Patrol Agent Benavides. Although campers are frequently seen by United States Courts as tools of the smuggling trade, see ([((('the vehicle that was stopped was carrying a camper, which are commonly used to transport aliens.')]; (finding that the defendant's ['vehicle, a truck with a camper shell which could easily hide several illegal aliens, was of a type frequently used by smugglers.']); Orona-Sanchez, 648 F.2d at 1041 (stating that ['the agents testified . . . that alien smuggling was frequently done by the use of a pickup with a camper shell.']), United States Magistrate Judge J. Scott Hacker gives little weight to this observation in the instant case because of the ambiguity surrounding the existence of the camper.

25  United States Border Patrol Agent Trevino noted that, ['from his experience, a lot of . . . smugglers use the rental vehicles used by smugglers, so that if they get caught or busted, they don't lose one of their own vehicles, they lose . . . a rental vehicle.''] See (stating that ['alien smugglers frequently use vehicles such as . . . rental vehicles to transport illegal aliens.'])
