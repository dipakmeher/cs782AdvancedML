An arrest without a warrant is proper only if probable cause supports it. (per curiam) (citing ; see also (per curiam) ('The United States Constitution does not require that a warrant issue prior to an arrest based on probable cause, even if no exigent circumstances prevented the obtainment of a warrant.'). 'Probable cause for a warrantless arrest exists when the totality of facts and circumstances within a law enforcement officer's knowledge at the moment of arrest are sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.' (citing another source); see also. An arresting law enforcement officer need only know with 'fair probability' that the defendant committed an offense, which requires more than a 'bare suspicion' but less than a preponderance of the evidence. (citing). In evaluating whether probable cause exists, United States Courts are to consider the 'collective knowledge' of the United States Border Patrol and Freer Police Department agents involved in the events which led to a defendant's arrest. 'Under the collective knowledge doctrine, it is not necessary for the arresting law enforcement officer to know all of the facts amounting to probable cause, so long as there is some degree of communication between the arresting law enforcement officer and an officer who has knowledge of all the necessary facts.' (citing).
