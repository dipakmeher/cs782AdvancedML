32  Confusingly,  IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. appeared to concede as much, when during the cross  examination of Hugo Benavides, he was able to get the United States Border Patrol agent to  agree to all of the following statements: 'Okay, but you . . .  were at the same location where Reymundo Reyes had stopped him to  give him a traffic citation, . . . and by that time, you knew that  there was a black Dodge pickup truck, you knew that the driver was a last name  RODRIGUEZ, and you knew that the black Dodge pickup truck was registered to somebody in  Corinth, Texas.' (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:54 p.m.). 'And you had  been listening to the radio about the stop that United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino made  on the white Malibu sedan, and that he had also caught, or found, five or six  illegal aliens . . . in the vehicle.' ( Id. ).  'So, by that time, you had information sufficient to arrest IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. on the spot once you arrived.' ( Id. ).

33  IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.  does not appear to argue that there was any United States Constitution violation or that Marco Montemayor somehow infringed upon his  constitutional rights, and therefore that issue is left unaddressed by the United States Courts.
