15  Freer Police Department Officer Reymundo Reyes could not recall exactly when IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. was informed that a canine was coming to conduct the search. (May 3rd Hr'g at 3:49 p.m.).

16  During his testimony, Freer Police Department Officer Reymundo Reyes explained that stolen vehicles are not necessarily reported stolen immediately, and thus the fact that the black Dodge pickup truck had yet to be reported did not alleviate his concerns. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:54 p.m.).

17  Reymundo Reyes further testified that it was within his rights to impound the  black Dodge pickup truck for lack of proof of insurance, and that it was a decision  within a 'law enforcement officer's' discretion. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:44,  3:57 p.m.). He has impounded between 'eight to ten'  vehicles since the beginning of the year because of 'no  driver's license, no insurance, . . . or expired registration.'  ( Id. at 3:58 p.m.).
