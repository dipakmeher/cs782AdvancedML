Corrected Response:
10 RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. appeared to dispute this observation by Agent Trevino when he testified to the following: "On my knowledge, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle did not go off the road. I'm pretty sure it did not, because I didn't get . . . nervous or anything like that . . . . Even when the agent approached me, asked me for every question, I mean I was very cooperative with him and everything, so, no, I don't . . . think I got off the road at all, pretty much . . . . Even when I stopped, I stopped right on the road." (May 3rd Hr'g at 2:59 p.m.).
