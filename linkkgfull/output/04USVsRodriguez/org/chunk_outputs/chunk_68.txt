28 IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. acknowledged during the hearing that he consented to have his vehicle, black Dodge pickup truck, searched, and thus the validity of the consent is not at issue.

29 Because IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "couldn't provide any insurance information," and because Officer Reyes "couldn't determine who the owner of the black Dodge pickup truck was," Reymundo Reyes became concerned that the black Dodge pickup truck was stolen and therefore decided to impound the black Dodge pickup truck while he was writing the citation. (citing) (emphasizing that officers are allowed to "draw on their own experience and specialized training" to make inferences from facts, such as "the fact that a vehicle has not yet been reported stolen does not necessarily mean that the vehicle has not actually been stolen."). Reymundo Reyes testified that he was within his rights to impound the black Dodge pickup truck based on IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s lack of proof of insurance. See , . However, this issue need not be directly addressed as it is not central to any of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s arguments. (See Court No. 39, at 2).
