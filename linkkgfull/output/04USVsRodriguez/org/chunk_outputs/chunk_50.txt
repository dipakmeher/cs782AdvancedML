4  The  testimony described Farm-to-Market Road 2050 as a paved road with  only two lanes, one in each direction. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:35-2:36  p.m.; see May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Ex. 12). Agent Trevino also testified that  "there's no shoulder" on Farm-to-Market Road 2050, so any vehicle straying  from the lane "will pick up rocks and dust." (May 2nd Hr'g  at 2:22, 2:35 p.m.). This Court therefore interprets Jorge Luis Trevino's  statements that the vehicles went "off the shoulder" to be  interchangeable with the statements that the vehicles went "off  the road."

5  Agent Trevino explained that most of the "vehicles that he encounters are Ford F-150s with brush guards, Ford F-250s with their head rack in the back." (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:11 p.m.). He continued: "If you look at the oil companies, most of them use Ford F-150s, white; they don't use Dodge Rams. That's how I distinguish them." ( Id. at 1:12 p.m.).
