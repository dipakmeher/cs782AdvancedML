24  Agent Trevino also testified that the black Dodge pickup truck had a "dark blue or black" camper. As noted before, this testimony went uncorroborated by Officer Reyes and Agent Benavides. Although campers are frequently seen by courts as tools of the smuggling trade, see ([(("the vehicle that was stopped was carrying a camper, which are commonly used to transport aliens.")]; (finding that the defendant's ["vehicle, a truck with a camper shell which could easily hide several illegal aliens, was of a type frequently used by smugglers."]); Orona-Sanchez, 648 F.2d at 1041 (stating that ["the agents testified . . . that alien smuggling was frequently done by the use of a pickup with a camper shell."]), the undersigned gives little weight to this observation in the instant case because of the ambiguity surrounding the existence of the camper.

25  Agent Trevino noted that, ["from his experience, a lot of . . . smugglers use the rental cars, so that if they get caught or busted, they don't lose one of their own vehicles, they lose . . . a rental car."] See (stating that ["alien smugglers frequently use vehicles such as . . . rental vehicles to transport illegal aliens."])
