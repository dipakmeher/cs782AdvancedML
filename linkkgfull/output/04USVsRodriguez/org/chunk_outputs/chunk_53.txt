Note: Since "RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle" is mentioned in the text and it maps to "white Malibu sedan" according to RESOLVED_ENTITIES, I replaced "the vehicle" with "RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle" which corresponds to "white Malibu sedan". However, upon re-examining the original instruction and the provided text chunk, it appears that only one alias directly matches an entry in RESOLVED_ENTITIES: "RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle". The rest of the replacements were not made as they did not match any aliases exactly as given in RESOLVED_ENTITIES. Therefore, the corrected response should reflect this understanding and only replace the exact matches found in RESOLVED_ENTITIES without adding or assuming information not provided.
