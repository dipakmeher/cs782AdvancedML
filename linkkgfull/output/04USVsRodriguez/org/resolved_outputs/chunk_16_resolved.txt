When dispatch soon thereafter advised Officer Reymundo Reyes that the "owner of the black Dodge pickup truck was a female, he asked IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. whose black Dodge pickup truck it was, and he said it was his aunt's black Dodge pickup truck." (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:41, 3:54 p.m.). Officer Reymundo Reyes also inquired into IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s travel plans, and he stated that he was "coming from Laredo, Texas, and he was going to Dallas, Texas," a statement which raised Officer Reymundo Reyes's suspicions, because "from Laredo, Texas to Dallas, Texas, the best route is Highway 35, and he was . . . taking Highway 16 towards San Antonio." (Id. at 3:41-3:42 p.m.). Officer Reymundo Reyes again asked about the owner of the black Dodge pickup truck, and IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "changed that it was from his aunt to that it belonged to his cousin." (Id. at 3:43 p.m.). All of Officer Reymundo Reyes's questions came prior to his issuing the citation. (Id. at 4:04 p.m.). Because IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "couldn't provide any insurance information, as soon as . . . Officer Reymundo Reyes couldn't determine who the owner of the black Dodge pickup truck was, . . . it was at that point that he didn't know if the black Dodge pickup truck was possibly stolen" and therefore decided to impound the black Dodge pickup truck. (Id. at 3:43-3:44 p.m.). The decision to impound the black Dodge pickup truck was made "at the moment that Officer Reymundo Reyes was writing the ticket," which was "approximately five minutes" after Officer Reymundo Reyes had made contact with IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. (Id. at 3:46, 3:59 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:44-3:45 p.m.). Officer Reymundo Reyes finished writing the citation after another three to five minutes and then returned the Defendant's driver's license. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:56, 4:05 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:24 p.m.). Although he "was going to let IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. go," Officer Reymundo Reyes testified that he "wasn't going to allow the black Dodge pickup truck to continue to its destination." (May 2nd Hr'g at 4:05 p.m.).
