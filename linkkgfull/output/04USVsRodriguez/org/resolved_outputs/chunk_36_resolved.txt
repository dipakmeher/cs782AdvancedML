Ignacio Rodriguez, Jr. also contends that Freer Police Department Officer Reymundo Reyes exceeded "the scope  of the stop and the nature of the interrogation that comes with a  traffic stop," (Dkt. No. 39, at 2), and thus we turn to Terry's second prong. A detention must be temporary and last no longer than  is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop, unless further  reasonable suspicion, supported by articulable facts, emerges. See,  e.g., .  A law enforcement officer conducting a routine traffic stop may request a driver's  license, insurance papers, and vehicle registration, run a computer  check thereon, and issue a citation. (citing other sources). The law enforcement officer may detain and question the  subjects of a traffic stop during the time a computer check is being  conducted, and a United States District Court will generally not scrutinize the particular  questions asked so long    as they do not extend the duration of the stop. (citing ; see  also (rejecting the notion that "a law enforcement officer's questioning,  even on a subject unrelated to the purpose of the stop, is itself a violation."). Mere questioning is neither a search nor a  seizure, and thus it is "detention, not questioning, that is  the evil at which Terry's second prong is aimed." (citing ).  "The United States District Court is concerned with ensuring that the scope of a given detention is reasonable under the totality of the circumstances." Id. (citing ).
