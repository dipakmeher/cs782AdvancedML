11 Agent Trevino noted this observation because, for United States Border Patrol agents, "it's very common to encounter illegal aliens wearing caps after walking through the brush." (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:23 p.m.). On cross examination, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. got Agent Trevino to concede that his written report said nothing about people wearing hats or people being stiff, nor did it indicate that Agent Trevino observed the vehicle riding low. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:14 p.m.). The report did include the observation that the vehicles repeatedly went off the road. ( Id. ).
