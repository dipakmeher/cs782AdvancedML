23 Although the white Malibu sedan was registered to Hertz Dallas-Fort Worth, Defendant IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. actually rented the white Malibu sedan at the Laredo International Airport. (May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Ex. 10). Defendant RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. elicited testimony from SANTIAGO HINOJOSA, a manager with the Hertz rental car company at the Laredo International Airport, that it was "not unusual" to rent a white Malibu sedan from one location that is registered to another city or state. (May 2nd Hr'g at 1:46 p.m.). White Malibu sedans currently at the Laredo airport location are registered to "New York, . . . Florida, Louisiana," as their registration "depends on where the company purchased them." (Id.). In essence, a rental vehicle's registration does not necessarily coincide with where the location the white Malibu sedan was in fact rented from. (Id. at 1:47 p.m.). Although JORGE LUIS TREVINO testified on cross examination that he knew Hertz has "rental car places all over," (id. at 3:32 p.m.), he was not asked whether he was aware that white Malibu sedans rented out of one location are registered to distant locations. Based on United States Border Patrol's recurrent testimony that the white Malibu sedan was out of "Dallas, Texas," it seems logical to infer that he was proceeding under the rational impression that the rental vehicle registered to Hertz Dallas-Fort Worth was in fact rented from the Highway 35 area.
