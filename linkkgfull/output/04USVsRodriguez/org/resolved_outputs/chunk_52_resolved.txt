10 RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. appeared to dispute this observation by United States Border Patrol Agent Trevino when he testified to the following: "On my knowledge, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle did not go off the road. I'm pretty sure it did not, because I didn't get . . . nervous or anything like that . . . . Even when the United States Border Patrol agent approached me, asked me for every question, I mean I was very cooperative with him and everything, so, no, I don't . . . think I got off the road at all, pretty much . . . . Even when I stopped, I stopped right on the road." (May 3rd Hr'g at 2:59 p.m.).

11 United States Border Patrol Agent Trevino noted this observation because, for United States Border Patrol agents, "it's very common to encounter illegal aliens wearing caps after walking through the brush." (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:23 p.m.). On cross examination, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. got United States Border Patrol Agent Trevino to concede that his written report said nothing about people wearing hats or people being stiff, nor did it indicate that United States Border Patrol Agent Trevino observed the vehicle riding low. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:14 p.m.). The report did include the observation that the vehicles repeatedly went off the road. ( Id. ).
