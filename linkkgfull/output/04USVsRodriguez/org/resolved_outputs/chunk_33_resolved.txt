"The seeks to prevent arbitrary police action, not to require absolute certainty before law enforcement officers may investigate," and thus "the reasonable suspicion standard clearly does not require an agent to 'eliminate all reasonable possibility of innocent travel before conducting an investigatory stop.'" (per curiam) (quoting). The majority of the Brignoni-Ponce factors, as scrutinized above, all contributed to the reasonable suspicion that IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s black Dodge pickup truck was involved in illegal activities. See (per curiam) (finding the "United States District Court properly relied, in part, upon the following facts in concluding that there was reasonable suspicion: the defendant was traveling on a common smuggling route, shortly after midnight; the law enforcement officer did not recognize the black Dodge pickup truck as a local vehicle; and the registration check on the defendant's black Dodge pickup truck revealed that it was registered near Dallas, Texas."); (per curiam) (concluding reasonable suspicion existed, based in large part on: "the area in which the stop took place was known for illegal activity; the law enforcement officer saw two vehicles traveling in tandem, and his experience taught him that vehicles engaged in smuggling almost always travel in tandem while other vehicles in the area almost never do; and the law enforcement officer, familiar with the area and its usual traffic, did not recognize either of the two vehicles"); ("Viewing the evidence as a collective whole through the lens of the law enforcement officers, finding the following factors provided the reasonable suspicion necessary to stop the defendant's black Dodge pickup truck: (1) his proximity to the United States-Mexico border (35 miles); (2) his proximity to a drug cache (2 miles); (3) his use of Highway 385 in an area known for drug smuggling (Big Bend); and (4) his behavior upon sign of the marked patrol car (he appeared stiff, stared straight ahead, failed to acknowledge the law enforcement officer, and slowed down considerably).")
