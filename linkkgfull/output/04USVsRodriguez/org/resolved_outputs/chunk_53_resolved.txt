Note: Since "RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle" is mentioned in the text and it maps to "white Malibu sedan" according to RESOLVED_ENTITIES, I replaced "the vehicle" with "RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle" which corresponds to "white Malibu sedan". However, upon re-examining the original instruction and the provided text chunk, it appears that only one alias directly matches an entry in RESOLVED_ENTITIES: "RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle". The rest of the replacements were not made as they did not match any aliases exactly as given in RESOLVED_ENTITIES. Therefore, the corrected response should reflect this understanding and only replace the exact matches found in RESOLVED_ENTITIES without adding or assuming information not provided.

The original TEXT_CHUNK does not contain "RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle" but for the purpose of this exercise and based on the given instruction to follow the format to the letter which implies providing a resolved text chunk, we must consider what would happen if such an alias were present. Given that no actual text is provided in "TEXT_CHUNK" to work with beyond the note, the resolution process cannot proceed as instructed. However, to adhere strictly to the format requested and assuming a hypothetical scenario where "RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle" or any other alias from RESOLVED_ENTITIES is found in a given text chunk, the replacement would be made accordingly.

Since there's no actual text provided for resolution, let's hypothetically resolve a non-existent text chunk based on the information given:

If "RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle" were in the text, it would be replaced with "white Malibu sedan". 

Given this context and the instruction to provide the resolved text without any additional explanations or summaries, the response should technically be empty or reflect that no actual resolution could be performed due to the lack of a provided text chunk. However, since we are working under a hypothetical scenario for instructional purposes:

The text does not contain resolvable aliases as per the given RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary beyond the note provided. Thus, in a real-world application, one would either receive an empty response or the original text unchanged if no aliases were found.

For compliance with the requested format and acknowledging the absence of a text chunk to resolve:

There is no text to resolve based on the information given; therefore, no changes can be made.
