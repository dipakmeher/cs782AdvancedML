Ortega-Chavez also objects to the manner in which a juror was questioned by both Judge Kazen and the U.S. Government Attorney in regard to her friendship with Defense counsel, Ms. Salinas. During the voir dire of the jury panel, Judge Kazen inquired if anyone on the panel was a close personal friend of Ms. Salinas or "anything of that sort." There was no response from any panel member or from Ms. Salinas. After the jury had been selected but prior to the commencement of any other proceedings in the case, it was revealed that one of the jurors knew Ms. Salinas. Judge Kazen thereupon questioned the juror, Mrs. Guerrero, out of the presence of the other jury members, as to her ability to be impartial. During this conference, the U.S. Government Attorney was allowed to ask the juror whether her friendship with another female lawyer in Laredo would unfairly affect her view of the case. Defense counsel made no objections. In fact, Defense counsel never in any way even intimated the slightest displeasure with this proceeding or with the juror. The juror stated twice that she could be "fair and impartial."
