The trial judge handled this case commendably. Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's suggestion on appeal that the in camera hearing in some way operated "to magnify the wrong," far from establishing plain error, is unsupported by a single shred of evidence. The decision to hold such a hearing is within the discretion of Judge Kazen. This U.S. Court has recognized Judge Kazen's responsibility under to inquire into a juror's ability to remain impartial. The decision to remove a juror for impartiality is within the sound discretion of Judge Kazen. Judge Kazen conducted an inquiry that was both brief and sensitive to the concerns of both parties, the United States Government and Alfredo Ortega-Chavez. He then gave Ms. Salinas for both parties, the United States Government and Alfredo Ortega-Chavez, an opportunity to question Mrs. Guerrero. Ms. Salinas declined this invitation. Mrs. Guerrero indicated that she could be "fair and impartial to both sides," the United States Government and Alfredo Ortega-Chavez. After repeated assurances from Mrs. Guerrero that she could remain nonpartisan, Judge Kazen determined that she was not prejudiced by her relationship with Ms. Salinas, Defense counsel for Alfredo Ortega-Chavez. That determination was not an abuse of discretion. See , .
