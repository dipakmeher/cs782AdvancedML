Substantial evidence was presented at trial that on November 21, 1980, Alfredo Ortega-Chavez and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez left the United States and entered Mexico at Nuevo Laredo. That same day, Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez applied for and received a permit to return to the United States with certain described merchandise. From Nuevo Laredo he and Alfredo Ortega-Chavez proceeded to Sabinas Hidalgo, Mexico. The next day, November 22, these two met with Alejandro Gonzalez Delgado and five undocumented aliens at a restaurant in Sabinas Hidalgo. From the restaurant, all eight took bus to Nuevo Laredo. The five undocumented aliens then took taxi from the Nuevo Laredo bus terminal to a point close to the bridge leading into the United States. Appellant Alfredo Ortega-Chavez, Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez, and Alejandro Gonzalez Delgado arrived at the bridge in van. Alfredo Ortega-Chavez instructed the five aliens to get into a hidden compartment in van and to remain silent. The van was driven by Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez. Approximately halfway across the bridge, Alfredo Ortega-Chavez got out of van.
