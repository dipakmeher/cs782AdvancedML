Alfredo Ortega-Chavez claims the district court erroneously permitted the government to call two unannounced rebuttal witnesses, in contravention of. When its witnesses were sworn prior to trial, the government volunteered that one of them might be called "as a rebuttal." At trial, Alfredo Ortega-Chavez did not testify and presented only one witness, Graciela Castaneda, whose sole testimony was that she and her husband had brunch with Alfredo Ortega-Chavez on November 22, 1980, at their home in San Antonio, Texas. Following Graciela Castaneda's testimony, the trial was recessed for the day. The next morning, at a conference prior to the jury being brought in, government counsel informed Judge Kazen and Ms. Salinas that he "just found this out yesterday that I did have some rebuttal witnesses" and that he would call Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's father and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's mother, neither of whom were among those previously sworn, to testify that Alfredo Ortega-Chavez was in Sabinas Hidalgo on November 21 and 22, and thus rebut the alibi given by Graciela Castaneda. Ms. Salinas then observed that at the beginning of trial the government "indicated that there would be just the possibility of maybe one rebuttal witness; which was" an individual other than either of Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's parents. However, no objection or motion was then or thereafter made respecting the testimony of these witnesses. The jury was then brought in, and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's father and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's mother testified, Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's father placing Alfredo Ortega-Chavez in Sabinas Hidalgo on November 22, 1980, and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's mother recalling having seen Alfredo Ortega-Chavez there on the evening of November 21, 1980.
