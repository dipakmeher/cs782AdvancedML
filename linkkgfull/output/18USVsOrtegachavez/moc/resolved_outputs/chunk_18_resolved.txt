We also note that Judge Kazen instructed the jury in Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial, both at the beginning of Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial and in his final charge, not to "infer or conclude from any ruling that I may make or anything I say that I have any opinion about this case one way or the other" and "not to assume from anything I may have said to any witness or to any attorney, or any ruling I have made that I have any opinion about the outcome of Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial one way or the other. . . . So, except for my legal instructions to you, I tell you that you should disregard anything else that I have said in reaching your verdict in the district court.
