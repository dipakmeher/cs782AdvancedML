Substantial evidence was presented at Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial that on November 21, 1980, Alfredo Ortega-Chavez and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez left the United States and entered Mexico at Nuevo Laredo. That same day, Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez applied for and received a permit to return to the United States with certain described merchandise. From Nuevo Laredo he and Alfredo Ortega-Chavez proceeded to Sabinas Hidalgo, Mexico. The next day, November 22, these two met with Alejandro Gonzalez Delgado and five undocumented aliens at a restaurant in Sabinas Hidalgo. From the restaurant, all eight took the bus to Nuevo Laredo. The five undocumented aliens then took the taxi from the Nuevo Laredo bus terminal to a point close to the bridge leading into the United States. Appellant Alfredo Ortega-Chavez, Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez, and Alejandro Gonzalez Delgado arrived at the bridge leading into the United States in the van used for smuggling. Alfredo Ortega-Chavez instructed the five aliens to get into a hidden compartment in the van used for smuggling and to remain silent. The van used for smuggling was driven by Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez. Approximately halfway across the bridge leading into the United States, Alfredo Ortega-Chavez got out of the van used for smuggling.
