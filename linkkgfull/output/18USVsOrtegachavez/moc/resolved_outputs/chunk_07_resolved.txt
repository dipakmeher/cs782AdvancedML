Alfredo Ortega-Chavez further argues that these U.S. Government Attorney rebuttal witnesses, who were present in the district court during previous testimony, were allowed to testify despite a sequestration order made pursuant to. Plain error is not established. While sequestration is mandatory, this district court has held that the district court has discretion to allow the testimony of a witness who has violated the Rule and that a U.S. Government Attorney must demonstrate an abuse of discretion and "sufficient prejudice" to warrant reversal on account of such testimony. , ; (en banc), modified on other grounds, (5th Cir.) (en banc), ; . Alfredo Ortega-Chavez is unable to demonstrate either an abuse of discretion or sufficient prejudice from the testimony of the two rebuttal witnesses. Their testimony merely confirmed that of four previous witnesses, that Alfredo Ortega-Chavez was in Sabinas Hidalgo on November 22, 1980. Moreover, the U.S. Government Attorney had no way of knowing that these rebuttal witnesses would be necessary until it heard the testimony of Graciela Castaneda that Alfredo Ortega-Chavez had been in San Antonio, Texas on the day in question.
