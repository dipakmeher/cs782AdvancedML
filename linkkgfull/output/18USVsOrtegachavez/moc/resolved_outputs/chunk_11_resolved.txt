The evidence was, to say the least, amply sufficient to sustain Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's conviction. While the testimony of the accomplice, Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez, revealed several inconsistencies with his prior deposition statements, such testimony was certainly not incredible as a matter of law. Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's challenge goes to credibility and weight, not competency. Issues of credibility, the weight of the evidence, and conflicts in evidence are matters for the district court. The testimony of the other U.S. Government Attorney witnesses not only corroborated Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's testimony, but also, standing alone, more than sufficient to support the guilty verdict in Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial.

Lastly, Alfredo Ortega-Chavez claims that Judge Kazen "failed to maintain the appearance of impartiality." This contention is wholly frivolous. We have examined the entire court record and it is plain that the able Judge Kazen conducted all the proceedings not only fairly, conscientiously, and competently but in a manner that was in all respects fully considerate, courteous, evenhanded, and impartial. Ms. Salinas' law firm is obliged to be fearless and resolute in resisting any judicial partiality, actual or apparent; equally, however, it is Ms. Salinas' law firm's duty to eschew utterly baseless charges of partiality or similar misconduct.

The evidence against Alfredo Ortega-Chavez is strong. He was fairly tried and convicted in the district court. There being no reversible error, the judgment is affirmed.
