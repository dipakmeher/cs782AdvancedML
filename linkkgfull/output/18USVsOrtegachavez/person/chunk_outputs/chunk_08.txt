Ortega-Chavez also objects to the manner in which a juror was  questioned by both the trial judge and the government's attorney in  regard to her friendship with defense counsel, Ms. Salinas. During  the voir dire of the jury panel, the district judge inquired if  anyone on the panel was a close personal friend of Ms. Salinas or  "anything of that sort." There was no response from any panel member or  from Ms. Salinas .  After the jury had been selected but prior to the commencement of  any other proceedings in the case, it was revealed that one of the  jurors knew Ms. Salinas. The district judge thereupon questioned the  juror, Mrs. Guerrero, out of the presence of the other jury members,  as to her ability to be impartial. During this conference, the  government's attorney was allowed to ask the juror whether her  friendship with another female lawyer in Laredo would unfairly  affect her view of the case. Defense counsel made no objections.  In  fact, defense counsel never in any way even intimated the slightest  displeasure with this proceeding or with the juror. The juror stated  twice that she could be "fair and impartial."
