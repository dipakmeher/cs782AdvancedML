A  Customs officer at the bridge, while inspecting the van's  merchandise for compliance with the entry permit, noticed that the  rear wall of the van on the inside appeared to be less deep than  would be suggested by looking at the outside of the van. The van was  inspected, the hidden compartment discovered, and Sanchez, Alejandro  Gonzalez Delgado, and the five undocumented    aliens were placed under arrest. Appellant Ortega-Chavez was  arrested later. Ortega-Chavez was charged with conspiracy to bring  or to attempt to bring undocumented aliens into the United States  and five counts of aiding and abetting Sanchez's attempt to bring  illegal aliens into the United States. The jury returned a verdict  of guilty as to each offense.
