Ortega-Chavez  claims the district court erroneously permitted the government to  call two unannounced rebuttal witnesses, in contravention of .     When its witnesses were sworn prior to trial, the government  volunteered that one of them might be called "as a  rebuttal.    " At trial, Ortega-Chavez did not testify and presented only  one witness, Graciela Castaneda, whose sole testimony was that she  and her husband had brunch with the appellant on November 22, 1980,  at their home in San  Antonio ,  Texas. Following Mrs. Castaneda's testimony, the trial was recessed  for the day. The next morning, at a conference prior to the jury  being brought in, government counsel informed the court and the  defense that he "just found this out yesterday that I did have  some rebuttal witnesses" and that he would call Ramon Gonzalez  Sanchez's parents, neither of whom were among those previously  sworn, to testify that appellant was in Sabinas Hidalgo on November  21 and 22, and thus rebut the alibi given by Mrs. Castaneda. Defense  counsel then observed that at the beginning of trial the government  "indicated that there would be just the possibility of maybe  one rebuttal witness; which was" an individual other than either of Sanchez's parents. However, no objection or motion  was then or thereafter made respecting the testimony of these  witnesses. The jury was then brought in, and Sanchez's parents  testified, his father placing the appellant in Sabinas Hidalgo on  November 22, 1980, and    his mother recalling having seen the appellant there on the evening  of November 21, 1980.
