On  appeal, Ortega-Chavez raises several claims of prejudicial error not  asserted below. It is well-established that   the failure to timely and properly raise these contentions before  the district court, either through objection, motion for mistrial,  or other appropriate manner, precludes us from reviewing them unless  they constitute plain error under .  See (plain error applies to failure to object to evidence introduced at  trial); (plain error applies to failure to object to waiver of counsel  hearing conducted in presence of jury venire); (plain error applies to failure to object to inculpatory    answer elicited during cross-examination); (plain error applies to failure to object to alleged prosecutorial  misconduct at trial).   Plain errors are "limited to those harmful ones that were so  rank that they should have been apparent to the trial judge without  objection, or that strike at the fundamental fairness, honesty, or  public reputation of the trial."
