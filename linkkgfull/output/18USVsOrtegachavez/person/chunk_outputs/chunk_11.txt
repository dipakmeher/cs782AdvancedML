The  evidence was, to say the least, amply sufficient to sustain  appellant's conviction. While the testimony of the accomplice, Ramon  Gonzalez Sanchez, revealed several inconsistencies with his prior  deposition statements, such testimony was certainly not incredible  as a matter of law. Appellant's challenge goes to credibility and weight, not  competency.   Issues of credibility, the weight of the evidence, and conflicts in  evidence are matters for the jury. .  The testimony of the other government witnesses not only  corroborated the accomplice's testimony, but also, standing alone,  more than sufficient to support the verdict.

Lastly, appellant claims that the trial court "failed to  maintain the appearance of impartiality." This contention is  wholly frivolous. We have examined the    entire record and it is plain that the able trial judge conducted  all the proceedings not only fairly, conscientiously, and  competently but in a manner that was in all respects fully  considerate, courteous, evenhanded, and impartial. Counsel is  obliged to be fearless and resolute in resisting any judicial  partiality, actual or apparent; equally, however, it is counsel's  duty to eschew utterly baseless charges of partiality or similar  misconduct.

The evidence against appellant is strong. He was fairly tried and  convicted. There being no reversible error, the judgment is  affirmed.

AFFIRMED.
