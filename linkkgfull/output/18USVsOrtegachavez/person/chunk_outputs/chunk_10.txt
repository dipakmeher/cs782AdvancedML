The  remainder of Ortega-Chavez's claims are entirely without merit and  do not warrant extended discussion. The allegation that the  government's attorney made unspecified prejudicial comments in  opening and closing arguments is raised for the first time on appeal  and is unsupported by the record. Defense counsel's objection to the  government's reference to a photo layout which included  Ortega-Chavez was cured by the court's prompt instruction and,    moreover, all of the government's witnesses later identified the  defendant by pointing to him in the courtroom. Equally thorough  limiting instructions were given when the government adduced  evidence of Ortega-Chavez's recent previous ventures into Mexico to  smuggle undocumented aliens into the United States, and these  instructions were    repeated in the court's final charge to the jury.

While Ortega-Chavez claims that the trial court wrongly failed to  inquire into his written waiver of a twelve-person jury, the record  neither contains nor suggests the existence of any such document (or  of any other waiver of a twelve-person jury). Further, the defendant  was tried before and convicted by a panel of twelve jurors.
