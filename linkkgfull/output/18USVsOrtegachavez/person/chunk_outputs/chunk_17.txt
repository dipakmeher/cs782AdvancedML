7  The  inconsistencies, moreover, did not in any direct sense relate to the  degree or extent of appellant's participation in the alien  smuggling operation. Sanchez's deposition testimony, a part of which was  introduced in evidence by the defense, plainly and strongly  implicated appellant.

8  The  one specific instance cited is the judge's statement, when the third  government witness was called, that, "Incidentally, ladies and  gentlemen, in case you're curious, we swore all these witnesses as a  group before you came in here. So they've all been sworn to tell the  truth under oath." Since the witnesses were all sworn out of  the presence of the jury, this remark was entirely proper and  helpful. At no time did defense counsel indicate any dissatisfaction  in this regard, nor did counsel below ever in any way raise any  complaints of lack of evenhandedness or request any "balancing"  ruling or instruction respecting any part of the trial.
