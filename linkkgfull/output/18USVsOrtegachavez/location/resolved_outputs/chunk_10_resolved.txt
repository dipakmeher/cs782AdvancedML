The remainder of Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's claims are entirely without merit and do not warrant extended discussion. The allegation that the government's attorney made unspecified prejudicial comments in opening and closing arguments is raised for the first time on appeal and is unsupported by the record. Ms. Salinas's objection to the government's reference to a photo layout which included Alfredo Ortega-Chavez was cured by Judge Kazen's prompt instruction and, moreover, all of the government's witnesses later identified Alfredo Ortega-Chavez by pointing to him in the courtroom. Equally thorough limiting instructions were given when the government adduced evidence of Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's recent previous ventures into Mexico to smuggle undocumented aliens into the United States, and these instructions were repeated in Judge Kazen's final charge to the jury.

While Alfredo Ortega-Chavez claims that Judge Kazen wrongly failed to inquire into his written waiver of a twelve-person jury, the record neither contains nor suggests the existence of any such document (or of any other waiver of a twelve-person jury). Further, Alfredo Ortega-Chavez was tried before and convicted by a panel of twelve jurors in the courtroom.
