Alfredo Ortega-Chavez claims the district court erroneously permitted the U.S. Government Attorney to call two unannounced rebuttal witnesses, in contravention of. When its witnesses were sworn prior to Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial, the U.S. Government Attorney volunteered that one of them might be called "as a rebuttal." At Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial, Alfredo Ortega-Chavez did not testify and presented only one witness, Graciela Castaneda, whose sole testimony was that she and her husband had brunch with Alfredo Ortega-Chavez on November 22, 1980, at their home in San Antonio, Texas. Following Graciela Castaneda's testimony, Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial was recessed for the day. The next morning, at a conference prior to the jury in Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial being brought in, U.S. Government Attorney informed Judge Kazen and Ms. Salinas' law firm that he "just found this out yesterday that I did have some rebuttal witnesses" and that he would call Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's father and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's mother, neither of whom were among those previously sworn, to testify that Alfredo Ortega-Chavez was in Sabinas Hidalgo on November 21 and 22, and thus rebut the alibi given by Graciela Castaneda. Ms. Salinas' law firm then observed that at the beginning of Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial the U.S. Government Attorney "indicated that there would be just the possibility of maybe one rebuttal witness; which was" an individual other than either of Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's parents. However, no objection or motion was then or thereafter made respecting the testimony of these witnesses. The jury in Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial was then brought in, and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's father and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's mother testified, Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's father placing Alfredo Ortega-Chavez in Sabinas Hidalgo on November 22, 1980, and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's mother recalling having seen Alfredo Ortega-Chavez there on the evening of November 21, 1980.
