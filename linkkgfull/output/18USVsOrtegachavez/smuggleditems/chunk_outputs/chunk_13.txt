"(b)  Disclosure of Information and Witness. Within ten days thereafter,  but in no event less than ten days before trial, unless the district court otherwise directs, the U.S. Government Attorney shall serve upon  the defendant or his attorney a written notice stating the names and  addresses of the witnesses upon whom the United States Government intends to rely  to establish the defendant's presence at the scene of the alleged  offense and any other witnesses to be relied on to rebut testimony  of any of the defendant's alibi witnesses.

"(c)  Continuing Duty to Disclose. If prior to or during Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's trial, a party  learns of an additional witness whose identity, if known, should  have been included in the information furnished under subdivision  (a) or (b), the U.S. Government Attorney shall promptly notify the other party or his  attorney of the existence and identity of such additional witness.

"(d)  Failure to Comply. Upon the failure of either party to comply with  the requirements of this rule, the district court may exclude the testimony  of any undisclosed witness offered by such party as to the  Alfredo Ortega-Chavez's absence from or presence at, the scene of the alleged  offense. This rule shall not limit the right of the defendant to  testify in his own behalf.
