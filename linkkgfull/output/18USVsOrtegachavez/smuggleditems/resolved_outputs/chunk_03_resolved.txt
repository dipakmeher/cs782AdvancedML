A U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer at the bridge leading into the United States, while inspecting the evidence against Alfredo Ortega-Chavez for compliance with the entry permit, noticed that the rear wall of the van on the inside appeared to be less deep than would be suggested by looking at the outside of the van. The van was inspected, the hidden compartment discovered, and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez, Alejandro Gonzalez Delgado, and the five undocumented aliens were placed under arrest. Alfredo Ortega-Chavez was arrested later. Alfredo Ortega-Chavez was charged with conspiracy to bring or to attempt to bring undocumented aliens into the United States and five counts of aiding and abetting Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's attempt to bring undocumented aliens into the United States. The district court returned a verdict of guilty as to each offense.
