On cross-examination Ms. Salinas' law firm brought out that these witnesses had been in the district court and had heard the testimony the previous day. Though neither had talked to the U.S. Government Attorney prosecuting the case until the morning on which they testified, Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez's father had previously talked to another U.S. Government Attorney in connection with procuring a lawyer for his son. However, as noted, at no time was any objection or motion made in regard to the testimony of either witness.

4 Juan Gonzalez Torres testified that he saw Alfredo Ortega-Chavez in a restaurant in Sabinas Hidalgo on both November 21, 1980 and November 22, 1980. Josefina Contreras de Gonzalez stated that she saw Alfredo Ortega-Chavez in a restaurant in Sabinas Hidalgo on the evening of November 21, 1980.

5 This inquiry was actually made twice, once respecting Ms. Salinas' law firm and once respecting Ms. Salinas' law firm and its members, including herself. Similar questions, of course, were asked concerning U.S. Government Attorney. The district court also had counsel for both sides rise and identify themselves.
