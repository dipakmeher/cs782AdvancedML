Under these provisions, the characterization of the alleged sentencing error is critical. A sentence imposed "outside the range of the applicable sentencing guideline" will be reversed only if it is unreasonable.

Findings of fact that underlie the district court's sentence are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.
