The Supreme Court has recognized that findings which require both assessment of complex evidence as well as sensitivity to legal purposes may nevertheless be factual. The Court has held that whether cause exists to dismiss a venireman is a factual question. "Cause" is obviously a complex thing to perceive, but, for purposes of appellate review, it is factual nonetheless. On the civil side, the Court has held that the existence of discrimination is a question of fact. Indeed, in criminal cases under the Continuing Criminal Enterprise statute, the defendant's status as a "manager"--precisely the issue raised by Juventino Mejia-Orosco--is a question of fact for the jury. See e.g., (terms "managed," "supervised," and "organized" are to be interpreted according to their ordinary, lay meaning).

Is not the only guideline provision calling upon district judges to make sophisticated factual determinations. Sections 3B1.2 (requiring the judge to decide whether the defendant was a "minimal participant" or "minor participant") and 3B1.3 (requiring the judge to decide, among other things, whether the defendant used a "special skill") demand comparable findings. Judicial fact-finding upon these matters will, like determinations of manager status, enjoy the protection of the "clearly erroneous" standard.
