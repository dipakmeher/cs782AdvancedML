In today's case, Juventino Mejia-Orosco does not challenge the information contained in the report. Rather, he contends that the evidence recited by the report does not justify the sentence imposed. Juventino Mejia-Orosco pled guilty to one count of illegally transporting an alien in violation of. The base offense level for such a violation is 9. Juventino Mejia-Orosco received a two-level reduction in this offense level for accepting responsibility for his offense. He had a criminal history category of I, the lowest category. With these factors, the sentencing table sets a range of 1-7 months imprisonment. The imposed sentence of 10 months is thus, in Juventino Mejia-Orosco's view, three months too long.

The district court, however, found that an offense level of 7 did not accurately reflect the nature of the crime committed. The court gave alternative justifications for raising the offense level to 9, which authorizes the stiffer 10-month sentence. First, the district court determined that Juventino Mejia-Orosco played an aggravating role in the offense; that is, he was an organizer, leader, or supervisor. Such a role in any criminal activity involving 2-5 participants warrants a 2-level increase in the offense level.
