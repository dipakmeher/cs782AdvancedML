By  enacting the sentencing guidelines Congress returned federal  sentencing to an earlier philosophy that the punishment should fit  the crime and that the main purpose of imprisonment is punishment.  Senator Edward M. Kennedy described the guidelines as "a  comprehensive and far reaching new approach . . . designed to  reduce the unacceptable disparity of punishment that plagues the  federal system, and . . . to assure sentences that are fair--and are  perceived to be fair--to offenders, victims, and society." 32  Fed.B. News & J. 60, 65 (1985). Similar crimes should be  punished similarly. To accomplish this goal, Congress limited the  discretion of district judges through the guidelines and    made the    sentence imposed determinate by abolishing parole. The guidelines  provide the analytic framework needed to create uniform sentences.  The accompanying abolishment of parole ensures that the imposed  sentence will be served.
