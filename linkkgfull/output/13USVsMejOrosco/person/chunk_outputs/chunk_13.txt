The  district court also justified the 2-level increase by reference to of the guidelines, which requires a 2-level increase in the offense  level if "the defendant previously has been convicted of  smuggling,    transporting, or harboring an unlawful alien, or related offense. .  . ." The district court classed a previous conviction for  unlawful entry as a "related offense" because Mejia-Orosco  was originally charged with transporting four illegal aliens,  although he eventually pled guilty to a reduced charge of illegal  entry. It is unclear whether the district court intended to apply  2L1.1(b)(2) directly, or to use it as the basis for a departure from  the guidelines. See §§ 4A1.3, 5K2.0. Mejia-Orosco argues on appeal that the district  court misapplied the guidelines when it made these determinations  and that this misapplication requires reversal of his sentence.  Because we affirm based upon the court's first justification for the  two-level increase, we do not reach the second.
