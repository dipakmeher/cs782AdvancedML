Maria De Jesus Garcia, by contrast, the testimony reflects a degree of loading that is more than merely "heavy" but is indeed obvious overloading (e.g., not only low in the rear, but to the extent that Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle weaves and headlights are noticeably angled up) -- consistent with the some twenty-two people carried by Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle. Moreover, United States v. Pacheco and United States v. Orona-Sanchez are also distinguishable from United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia, in that the weaving and lowered rear of the truck and the fogged windows of the camper shell here indicated not only that the camper carried a most unusually heavy cargo, but that the cargo was breathing.
