Pruszenski was driving the agents' patrol car. While traveling alongside the truck cab, Baron leaned out of the window of the patrol car and observed three females in the front seat of the truck cab and five or six men in the back seat of the truck cab. When Baron shined his flashlight into the truck cab, according to the agents, the male passengers attempted to conceal themselves by ducking and scrambling down below the window. The agents testified that the men's clothes and hair appeared unwashed, dirty and "very unruly and unkempt," a characteristic considered common to individuals who have recently spent time in the brush.

Their suspicion aroused, the agents stopped Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle for an immigration inspection on Interstate Highway 35. Upon questioning, the driver and several passengers admitted to the agents that they were Mexican citizens without immigration documents. After receiving this information, the agents then opened the rear window to the camper compartment of Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle and found fourteen additional males lying down on the floor of the camper, all of whom admitted they were illegal aliens. The agents arrested the border patrol agents, then arrested Maria De Jesus Garcia, the owner of the camper, and Lourdes Rangel-Campos, the driver, and took the remaining passengers into custody.
