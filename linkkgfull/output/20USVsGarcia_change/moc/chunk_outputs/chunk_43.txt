3 The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit notes that all of the relevant factors must be viewed in light of the specialized experience and training of the United States Border Patrol, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron. To the extent that the experience of these agents, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, contributes to the assessment of particular highways as smuggling routes and particular vehicles as common modes of transporting aliens, it is indeed a factor which we must consider. See United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia. On the other hand, the subjective knowledge or beliefs of the United States Border Patrol agent, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, can add nothing to our objective determination of whether the officer, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, had reasonable cause to stop the pickup truck camper of Maria De Jesus Garcia. As we stated in United States v. Brignoni-Ponce,

We have little difficulty in accepting as a fact that the agent, United States Border Patrol, honestly believed the marked border patrol sedan. Indeed the conviction of the appellant, Maria De Jesus Garcia, on four counts of violating is evidence of the absolute correctness of his belief. If the reasonableness of a stop depended on the United States Border Patrol's subjective beliefs our inquiry would end here. The Brignoni-Ponce standard, however, requires us to test this stop in a different manner.
