Their suspicion aroused, the United States Border Patrol agents stopped Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper for an immigration inspection on Interstate Highway 35. Upon questioning, the driver and several passengers admitted to the United States Border Patrol agents that they were Mexican citizens without immigration documents. After receiving this information, the United States Border Patrol agents then opened the rear window of the pickup truck camper and found fourteen additional males lying down on the floor of the pickup truck camper, all of whom admitted they were illegal aliens. The United States Border Patrol agents arrested Maria De Jesus Garcia, the owner of the pickup truck camper, and Lourdes Rangel-Campos, the driver, and took the remaining passengers into custody.

Before trial, defense counsel moved to suppress evidence obtained by the government as a result of the stop and search of the pickup truck camper. Defense counsel also moved to extend the deadline for filing the suppression motion, which had already passed. Although the United States District Court denied the extension motion, it allowed the defendant at trial to present evidence pertinent to the suppression motion, and made oral findings of fact regarding the constitutionality of the stop and search, concluding that they were proper. The government on appeal waives any objection to the timeliness of the pickup truck camper's suppression motion, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit considers it on its merits.
