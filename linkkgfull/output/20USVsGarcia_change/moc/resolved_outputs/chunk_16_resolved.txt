Dissent

TATE, Circuit Judge, dissenting:

A pickup truck camper was stopped at about 11:30 p.m. by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron on Interstate Highway 35 in Texas some 115 miles north of the United States-Mexican border. So far as United States Border Patrol were able to glimpse, there were three women in the front seat of the pickup truck camper and five or six men in the back seat of the pickup truck camper. To the pickup truck camper was affixed a heavily loaded camper attachment. The essential issue concerns the lawfulness or not of the stop of this pickup truck camper. Believing that, stripped to its essence, the stop was based upon no more than United States Border Patrol's speculation that poor and dirty Hispanic appearing persons might possibly be Mexican aliens who had crossed the United States-Mexican border illegally some 115 miles south of the stop, and that "reasonable suspicion" of illegal alien entry cannot be based upon the mere circumstance that a crowded pickup truck camper of dirty appearing Hispanic-descended workmen is traveling on an Interstate Highway at 11:30 in the evening, I, TATE, must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion, which, I concede, is excellent and thorough and has fairly presented the factual picture.
