Maria De Jesus Garcia also argues that the modified Allen charge was particularly coercive as used in this case because the modified Allen charge was given to the jury on a Friday afternoon, after the jury had twice indicated that it was deadlocked and that the dissenting jurors' decisions were irreversible. Maria De Jesus Garcia contends the modified Allen charge coerced the dissenting jurors, who Maria De Jesus Garcia presumes desired an acquittal, into voting to convict. The decision on whether the modified Allen charge should be given, and when it should be given, "is within the sound discretion of the United States District Court." We find no abuse of discretion here.
