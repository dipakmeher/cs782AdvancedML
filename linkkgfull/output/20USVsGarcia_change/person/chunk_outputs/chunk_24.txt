Another  factor relied upon by the majority is also, in my view,    unworthy of meaningful weight.  The court refers to the lateness of  the hour as a relevant consideration adding to reasonable suspicion.  We have held, however, that a "decision to travel such roads at  less busy hours should not be the difference -- constitutionally  speaking -- determinative of the right of the officers to stop  vehicles." .

Admittedly,  however, other factors relied upon by the majority perhaps do merit  consideration, e.g. ,  the previous experience of the agents with illegal alien traffic on  the highway, the type of vehicle driven by Garcia, and the unkempt  appearances of the truck's occupants. Carefully weighing these remaining factors, I conclude that the  officers had insufficient articulable facts to support a reasonable  suspicion that the truck driven by Garcia was transporting illegal  aliens. Foremost among my concerns are (1) the distance between the  border and the point at which the stop occurred, and (2) my  hesitation to credit the ability of border patrol agents to  distinguish an illegal alien from a lawful resident, based on  physical appearances, after a few quick glimpses while  traveling    at considerable speeds on a highway.
