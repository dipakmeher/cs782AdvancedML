Whether  a person appears "dirty" or "unkempt" varies  greatly with the subjective perceptions of the person making the  assessment.  The standard will differ with each agent's experience  and attitude about the typical appearance of an illegal alien. While  I concede that this factor is worthy of some consideration, I cannot  contribute controlling weight -- in the sense of the  constitutionality of a stop -- to the hygienic appearances of a  vehicle's occupants as interpreted by border patrol agents.

I do not mean to suggest that this combination of factors (the  reputation of the highway as a common smuggling route, the type of  vehicle driven by the defendant, and the appearance of the vehicle's  occupants) could never constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop by  border patrol agents if at a distance closer to the border than that  involved here.  Nonetheless, when a vehicle is traveling 115 miles  from the border and no permissible inference can be made that it  came from the border, I conclude that the factors presented to this  court that are worthy of consideration in light of the precedents of  this circuit, as I view them, cannot rise to the level of reasonable  suspicion without also subjecting innocent persons who lawfully  reside in this country to intrusive stops by border patrol agents  based primarily on their appearance as being of Hispanic descent. Conclusion

For  these reasons, and with great respect for the contrary views of my  brethren, I dissent.
