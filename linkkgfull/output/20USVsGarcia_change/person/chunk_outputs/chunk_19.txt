In  the absence of an inference that the vehicle to be stopped came from  the border, the remaining factors known to the    agents must be carefully examined to determine whether "other  articulable facts 'reasonably warrant suspicion'". .  In the present case, the remaining factors relied upon by the  majority included: other illegal aliens had been seized near the  location where the agents encountered Garcia; the interstate highway  on which Garcia was traveling was "a common smuggling route";  the occupants of Garcia's truck were unwashed and unkempt; the type  of truck driven by Garcia, a pickup truck with a camper shell  attached to the back of it, is often used to transport illegal  aliens; the windows of the camper shell attachment appeared to be  fogged, suggesting that the camper carried living cargo; the  lateness of the hour at the time of the stop; the scrambling of the  occupants of the truck when the border patrol agent shined his  flashlight at them; the seemingly heavy load in the truck; the speed  of the truck; and the specialized training of the border patrol  agents involved    in the stop.  Because I believe that the consideration of several of  these factors departs from the precedents of this circuit, despite  the majority's distinguishment of them as not controlling, and that  the remaining factors cannot, standing alone, support the stop of  Garcia's truck, I cannot join the opinion of the panel majority,  excellently reasoned as it is.
