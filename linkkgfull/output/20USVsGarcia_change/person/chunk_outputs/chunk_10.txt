"It  is well settled that   probable cause to search an automobile exists when trustworthy facts  and circumstances within the officer's personal knowledge would  cause a reasonably prudent man to believe that the vehicle contains  contraband.  We must also be mindful that 'probable cause is the sum  total of layers of information and the synthesis of what the police  have heard, what they know, and what they observed as trained  officers.  We weigh not individual layers but the "laminated"  total.'" (5th Cir.) (en banc),  (citations omitted).

Once  several passengers of Garcia's    vehicle admitted to the agents that they were undocumented aliens,  that fact, coupled with those observations suggesting that there  were other individuals within the camper compartment, provided  probable cause to search the camper for other illegal aliens. Thus,  no violation resulted from either the stop or search of Garcia's  vehicle, and her argument to that effect must fail.

THE ALLEN CHARGE

Garcia  launches a two-pronged attack against the modified Allen charge given to the jury below.  First, she argues that use of any  form of the Allen charge is coercive and thus violates the right to a fair trial.  Second, she contends that the Allen charge, even if not inherently prejudicial, was unduly coercive in  the context of this case.
