1  Garcia  asserts that the passengers' allegedly evasive actions were merely attempts to avoid eye contact with the beam from the flashlight shined by Agent Baron into  the truck cab. If Garcia's characterization of the facts is correct,  then we must disregard these actions, because "the avoidance of  eye contact can have no weight whatsoever" in the suspicion  calculus. .  Moreover, "it is not unusual for one . . . to be startled by  lights being flashed suddenly into the interior of his vehicle."  .  Pruszenski and Baron testified, however, that the passengers in the  back seat of the cab did much  more than merely avoid eye contact with Baron's flashlight. Pruszenski testified that when the  light was shone into the cab, "behind the cab's front seat,  we could observe five or six people moving and slouching low as to  get out of the light trying to hide." Baron, who was closer to  the vehicle carrying the aliens, testified:

"As  soon as I turned on the flashlight, there was a male . . . looking  out the window in this crew cab. As soon as I turned on the  flashlight, he ducked, and the rest of the men were making the  biggest effort they could to conceal themselves where they could not  be seen.
