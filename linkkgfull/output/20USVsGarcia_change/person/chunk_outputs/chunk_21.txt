We have also refused to accord weight to the observations of border  patrol agents that a vehicle's occupants "hunkered down"  when the agents passed or were sitting low so as to avoid detection, see ; ,  or that the occupants of a vehicle were startled by the beam of a  border patrol agent's flashlight.  .  The majority reasons that these decisions are inapposite since the  occupants of Garcia's truck "did much  more than merely avoid eye contact with the agent's flashlight." (Maj. op. at 1224 n.  1).  The agents testified that the occupants were "moving and  slouching low as to get out of the light trying to hide." Agent  Baron testified that, after he shined his flashlight into the truck,  "they were scrambling around trying to get lower than the  windows were so that . . . I couldn't see them with a flashlight.  They were scrambling around in the interior there." The    majority considered this testimony relevant since "ducking and  scrambling around is certainly    less typical of innocent passengers than slouching or hunkering  down." (Maj. op. at 1225).
