3  The  majority notes that all of the relevant factors must be viewed in  light of the specialized experience and training of the border  patrol agents.  To the extent that the experience of these agents  contributes to the assessment of particular highways as smuggling  routes and particular vehicles as common modes of transporting  aliens, it is indeed a factor which we must consider.

If the  reasonableness of a stop depended on the border patrol agent's  subjective beliefs our inquiry would end here.  The ,  however, requires us to test this stop in a different manner.
