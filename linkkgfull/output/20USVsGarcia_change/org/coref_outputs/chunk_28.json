  "AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS": {
    "United States District Court": "court that made unassailed findings and oral findings of fact regarding the constitutionality of the stop and search, also referencing the Brignoni-Ponce standard in its decisions, and gave a modified Allen charge to the jury, and refused to allow post-verdict discovery through juror depositions and interrogatories. The court affirmed the judgment.",
    "United States Border Patrol": "law enforcement agency involved in border surveillance, smuggling interception, and immigration inspections, with agents making stops based on reasonable suspicion, including assessments of individuals' appearances.",
    "United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit": "appellate court considering the suppression motion on its merits, articulating principles for investigatory stops near the United States-Mexican border, and relying on an agent's observation, also providing guidance on probable cause to search vehicles, and upholding the use of the modified Allen charge. The court is currently reviewing whether roving border patrol agents may stop persons based on appearance and claimed expertise, and has made decisions that have upheld stops by immigration agents. The court refers to the lateness of the hour as a relevant consideration adding to reasonable suspicion.",
    "United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia": "a legal case involving a challenge to the modified Allen charge given to the jury and a request for post-verdict discovery through juror depositions and interrogatories",

    "United States v. Pacheco": "a legal case referenced in determining the justification for investigatory stops, and affirming the rejection of a general attack on the Allen charge",
    "United States v. Orona-Sanchez": "a legal case referenced in determining the justification for investigatory stops, and upholding the use of the modified Allen charge",
    "United States": "country of origin relevant to immigration and smuggling cases, referenced in case citations, and differentiated from police states due to its constitutional protections against unreasonable searches.",
    "Brignoni-Ponce standard": "legal standard guiding reasonable suspicion for investigatory stops near the border. The dissenting opinion questioned whether the stop was based on reasonable suspicion under this standard.",
    "U.S.-Mexican border": "an international border relevant to immigration and smuggling cases, with its proximity being a factor in justifying investigatory stops.",
    "United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit as the majority": "appellate court making decisions regarding the justification of investigatory stops based on factors such as vehicle loading",
    "Maria De Jesus Garcia": "defendant in a legal case involving a challenge to the modified Allen charge given to the jury and a request for post-verdict discovery through juror depositions and interrogatories",
    "Alfred Baron": "border patrol agent involved in the stop and search of a pickup truck camper, who testified about the passengers' actions when a flashlight was shone into the vehicle",
