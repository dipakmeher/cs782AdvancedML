  "AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS": {
    "United States District Court": "court that made unassailed findings and oral findings of fact regarding the constitutionality of the stop and search, also referencing the Brignoni-Ponce standard in its decisions, and gave a modified Allen charge to the jury, and refused to allow post-verdict discovery through juror depositions and interrogatories. The court affirmed the judgment.",
    "United States Border Patrol": "law enforcement agency involved in border surveillance, smuggling interception, and immigration inspections, with agents making stops based on reasonable suspicion, including factors such as vehicle appearance and passenger behavior. Agents Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron stopped a pickup truck camper on Interstate Highway 35. The agency's actions have been reviewed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit regarding the constitutionality of stops. The agents also use vehicles like the border patrol sedan for their operations.",
    "United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit": "appellate court considering the suppression motion on its merits, articulating principles for investigatory stops near the United States-Mexican border, and relying on an agent's observation, also providing guidance on probable cause to search vehicles, and upholding the use of the modified Allen charge. The court is currently reviewing whether roving border patrol agents may stop persons based on appearance and claimed expertise, and has made decisions that have upheld stops by immigration agents. The court refers to the lateness of the hour as a relevant consideration adding to reasonable suspicion.",
    "United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia": "a legal case involving a challenge to the modified Allen charge given to the jury and a request for post-verdict discovery through juror depositions and interrogatories",
    "United States-Mexican border": "an international border relevant to immigration and smuggling cases, with its proximity being a factor in justifying investigatory stops. The stop occurred 115 miles north of the border.",
    "Interstate Highway 35": "a highway where smuggling and illegal alien traffic have been reported, leading directly to the United States-Mexican border but passing through several towns, and a location of an investigatory stop. A pickup truck camper was stopped on this highway.",
    "United States v. Pena-Cantu": "a legal case referenced in determining the justification for investigatory stops, and rejecting a general attack on the Allen charge as being inherently coercive",
    "United States v. Pacheco": "a legal case referenced in determining the justification for investigatory stops, and affirming the rejection of a general attack on the Allen charge",
    "United States v. Orona-Sanchez": "a legal case referenced in determining the justification for investigatory stops, and upholding the use of the modified Allen charge",
    "United States": "country of origin relevant to immigration and smuggling cases, referenced in case citations, and differentiated from police states due to its constitutional protections against unreasonable searches.",
    "Brignoni-Ponce standard": "legal standard guiding reasonable suspicion for investigatory stops near the border. The dissenting opinion questioned whether the stop was based on reasonable suspicion under this standard.",
    "U.S.-Mexican border": "an international border relevant to immigration and smuggling cases, with its proximity being a factor in justifying investigatory stops.",
    "United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit as the majority": "appellate court making decisions regarding the justification of investigatory stops based on factors such as vehicle loading"
