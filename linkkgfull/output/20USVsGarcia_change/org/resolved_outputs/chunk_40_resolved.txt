1. Other factors also persuade the majority of the court of the relevance of the heavy-load factor, such as the squashed tires of pickup truck camper, the angle upward of pickup truck camper's headlights, the slow speed of pickup truck camper, and the weaving of pickup truck camper. While it is true that a heavy truck may have squashed tires and angled headlights and be difficult to maneuver, these facts have no bearing on the basic principle that operating a heavily loaded truck is no more consistent with guilty conduct than it is with innocent conduct. It is also possible, of course, that the tires may have been under-inflated and that the headlights were improperly aligned, indicating the questionable relevance of these factors when viewed "charily", as our precedents require.

2. Under the circumstances of United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia, I can attribute no weight to the officers' observance that the windows of the pickup truck camper on pickup truck camper appeared to be fogged. Under a cautious view of the facts I simply cannot infer that the appearance of a fogged window on a cold night would be caused solely by living, breathing cargo. Even if I were to accept that inference, I cannot find any basis for the further conclusion that the living cargo was human and illegally attempting to enter the United States.
