We have little difficulty in accepting as a fact that the agent, United States Border Patrol, honestly believed the marked border patrol sedan. Indeed the conviction of the appellant, Maria De Jesus Garcia, on four counts of violating is evidence of the absolute correctness of his belief. If the reasonableness of a stop depended on the United States Border Patrol's subjective beliefs our inquiry would end here. The Brignoni-Ponce standard, however, requires us to test this stop in a different manner.
