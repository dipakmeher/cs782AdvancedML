Maria De Jesus Garcia launches a two-pronged attack against the modified Allen charge given to the jury below in United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia.  First, she argues that use of any form of the Allen charge is coercive and thus violates the right to a fair trial.  Second, she contends that the Allen charge, even if not inherently prejudicial, was unduly coercive in the context of this case.

At the outset, we note that "it is well settled in this circuit that the Allen charge is permissible, within the limitations of our prior decisions." (footnote omitted). Maria De Jesus Garcia does not attack the language of the Allen charge used below by the United States District Court, which "was well within these limitation."

In United States v. Pena-Cantu, aff'd en banc, United States v. Pacheco, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected a general attack on the Allen charge as being inherently coercive in any form. Id., 468 F.2d at 661, 480 F.2d at 518. Accord, United States v. Orona-Sanchez. "The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has repeatedly upheld the use of the modified Allen charge." Unless sitting en banc, we are bound by the prior decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
