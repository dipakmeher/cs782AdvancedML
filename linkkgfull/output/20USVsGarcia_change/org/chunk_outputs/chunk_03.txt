Pruszenski was driving the marked border patrol sedan. While traveling alongside the pickup truck camper, Baron leaned out of the window of the marked border patrol sedan and observed three females in the front seat of the pickup truck camper and five or six men in the back seat of the pickup truck camper. When Baron shined his flashlight into the pickup truck camper, according to the agents, the male passengers attempted to conceal themselves by ducking and scrambling down below the window. The agents testified that the men's clothes and hair appeared unwashed, dirty and "very unruly and unkempt," a characteristic considered common to individuals who have recently spent time in the brush.

Their suspicion aroused, the agents stopped Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper for an immigration inspection on Interstate Highway 35. Upon questioning, the driver and several passengers admitted to the agents that they were Mexican citizens without immigration documents. After receiving this information, the agents then opened the rear window to the camper compartment of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper and found fourteen additional males lying down on the floor of the pickup truck camper, all of whom admitted they were illegal aliens. The agents arrested the border patrol agents, then arrested Maria De Jesus Garcia, the owner of the pickup truck camper, and Lourdes Rangel-Campos, the driver, and took the remaining passengers into custody.
