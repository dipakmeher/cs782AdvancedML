In the absence of an inference that Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle to be stopped came from the United States-Mexican border, the remaining factors known to the agents must be carefully examined to determine whether "other articulable facts 'reasonably warrant suspicion'". In the present case, the remaining factors relied upon by the majority included: other illegal aliens had been seized near the location where Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron encountered Maria De Jesus Garcia; the Interstate Highway 35 on which Maria De Jesus Garcia was traveling was "a common smuggling route"; the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle were unwashed and unkempt; the type of vehicle driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, a pickup truck with a camper attached to the back of it, is often used to transport illegal aliens; the windows of the camper attachment appeared to be fogged, suggesting that the camper carried living cargo; the lateness of the hour at the time of the stop on Interstate Highway 35 near Cotulla, Texas; the scrambling of the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle when Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron shined their flashlight at them; the seemingly heavy load in Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle; the speed of Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle; and the specialized training of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron involved in the stop on Interstate Highway 35 near Cotulla, Texas. Because the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit believes that the consideration of several of these factors departs from the precedents of this circuit, despite the majority's distinguishment of them as not controlling, and that the remaining factors cannot, standing alone, support the stop of Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit cannot join the opinion of the panel majority, excellently reasoned as it is.
