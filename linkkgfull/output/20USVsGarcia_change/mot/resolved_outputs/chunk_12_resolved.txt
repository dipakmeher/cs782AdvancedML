Maria De Jesus Garcia also argues that the Allen charge was particularly coercive as used in this case because the charge was given to the jury on a Friday afternoon, after the jury had twice indicated that it was deadlocked and that the dissenting jurors' decisions were irreversible. Maria De Jesus Garcia contends the charge coerced the dissenting jurors, who Maria De Jesus Garcia presumes desired an acquittal, into voting to convict. The decision on whether the Allen charge should be given, and when it should be given, "is within the sound discretion of the trial judge." We find no abuse of discretion here.
