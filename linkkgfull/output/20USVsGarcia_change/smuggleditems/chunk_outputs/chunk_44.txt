3  The  majority of the court notes that all of the relevant factors must be viewed in  light of the specialized experience and training of the United States Border Patrol.  To the extent that the experience of these agents, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, contributes to the assessment of particular highways as smuggling  routes and particular vehicles as common modes of transporting  aliens, it is indeed a factor which we must consider. See .  On the other hand, the subjective knowledge or beliefs of the United States Border Patrol agent, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, can add nothing to our objective determination of  whether the officer, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, had reasonable cause to stop the pickup truck camper of Maria De Jesus Garcia.  As we  stated in ,
We  have little difficulty in accepting as a fact that the United States Border Patrol agent, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, honestly believed the marked United States Border Patrol sedan. Indeed the  conviction of the appellant, Maria De Jesus Garcia, on four counts of violating is evidence of the absolute correctness of his belief.  If the  reasonableness of a stop depended on the United States Border Patrol agent's, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, subjective beliefs our inquiry would end here.  The Brignoni-Ponce standard,  however, requires us to test this stop in a different manner.
