"It is well settled that probable cause to search an automobile exists when trustworthy facts and circumstances within the officer's personal knowledge would cause a reasonably prudent man to believe that the vehicle contains contraband. We must also be mindful that 'probable cause is the sum total of layers of information and the synthesis of what the police have heard, what they know, and what they observed as trained officers. We weigh not individual layers but the \"laminated\" total.' (United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia) (en banc), (citations omitted).

Once several passengers of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper admitted to marked United States Border Patrol sedan that they were undocumented aliens, that fact, coupled with those observations suggesting that there were other individuals within the pickup truck camper, provided probable cause to search the pickup truck camper for other undocumented aliens. Thus, no violation resulted from either the stop on United States-Mexican border or search of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, and Maria De Jesus Garcia's argument to that effect must fail.
