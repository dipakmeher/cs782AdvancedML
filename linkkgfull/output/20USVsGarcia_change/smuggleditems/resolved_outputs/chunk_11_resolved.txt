Maria De Jesus Garcia launches a two-pronged attack against the modified Allen charge given to the jury in United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia.  First, she argues that use of any form of the modified Allen charge is coercive and thus violates the right to a fair trial.  Second, she contends that the modified Allen charge, even if not inherently prejudicial, was unduly coercive in the context of this case.

At the outset, we note that "it is well settled in United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia that the modified Allen charge is permissible, within the limitations of our prior decisions." (footnote omitted). Maria De Jesus Garcia does not attack the language of the modified Allen charge used by United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia, which "was well within these limitation."

In United States v. Pena-Cantu, aff'd en banc, United States v. Pacheco, United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia rejected a general attack on the modified Allen charge as being inherently coercive in any form. Id., 468 F.2d at 661, 480 F.2d at 518. Accord, United States v. Orona-Sanchez. "United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia has repeatedly upheld the use of the modified Allen charge." Unless sitting en banc, we are bound by the prior decisions of United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia.
