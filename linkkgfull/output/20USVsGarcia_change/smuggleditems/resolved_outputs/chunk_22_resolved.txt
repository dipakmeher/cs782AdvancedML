We have also refused to accord weight to the observations of marked United States Border Patrol sedan that pickup truck camper's occupants "hunkered down" when the marked United States Border Patrol sedan passed or were sitting low so as to avoid detection, see ; , or that the occupants of the marked United States Border Patrol sedan were startled by the beam of a flashlight. The United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia reasons that these decisions are inapposite since the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper "did much more than merely avoid eye contact with the flashlight." (Maj. op. at 1224 n. 1). The marked United States Border Patrol sedan testified that the occupants were "moving and slouching low as to get out of the light trying to hide." Stanley Pruszenski testified that, after he shined his flashlight into Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, "they were scrambling around trying to get lower than the windows were so that . . . I couldn't see them with a flashlight. They were scrambling around in the interior of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper." The United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia considered this testimony relevant since "ducking and scrambling around is certainly less typical of innocent passengers than slouching or hunkering down." (Maj. op. at 1225).
