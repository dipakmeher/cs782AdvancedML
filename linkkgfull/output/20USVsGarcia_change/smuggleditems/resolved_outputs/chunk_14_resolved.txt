Maria De Jesus Garcia's final contention is that the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia erred in refusing to allow her to conduct post-verdict "discovery" through juror depositions and interrogatories in order to determine whether the jury in United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia were coerced by the modified Allen charge.

"Historically, interrogations of jurors have not been favored by United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia except where there is some showing of illegal or prejudicial intrusion into the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia." , (emphasis in original). Accord, . The only intrusion alleged here was the giving of the modified Allen charge to the jury in United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia, which we have held was not error. That is not the type of "illegal or prejudicial intrusion into the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia" that might justify post-verdict interviews of jurors.
