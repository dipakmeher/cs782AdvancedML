Before trial, defense counsel moved to suppress evidence obtained by the government as a result of the stop and search of the pickup truck camper. Defense counsel also moved to extend the deadline for filing the suppression motion, which had already passed. Although the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia denied the extension motion, it allowed Maria De Jesus Garcia at trial to present evidence pertinent to the suppression motion, and made oral findings of fact regarding the constitutionality of the stop and search, concluding that they were proper. The government on appeal waives any objection to the timeliness of the pickup truck camper's suppression motion, and the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia considers it on its merits.

To justify the suppression of evidence in this case, the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia must consider first, whether there was a sufficient basis to stop the pickup truck camper, and second, whether there was probable cause to permit the subsequent search of the pickup truck camper.
