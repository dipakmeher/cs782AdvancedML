On February 18, 1983, marked United States Border Patrol sedan agents Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron were sitting in their marked United States Border Patrol sedan overlooking the northbound lanes of Interstate Highway 35 just south of Moore, Texas about 115 miles from the United States-Mexican border. At approximately 11:30 p.m., Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron spotted a pickup truck camper traveling northbound unusually slowly, its headlights angled up. The marked United States Border Patrol sedan agents entered traffic to further observe the pickup truck camper. They saw that its bumper was low, its tires "were squashed down," the wheel wells were covering part of the tires, and it was loaded heavily in the rear. The pickup truck camper was weaving, it appearing "that the driver was having a hard time controlling the vehicle due to the weight in the back, making the front end light." When the marked United States Border Patrol sedan agents pulled their marked United States Border Patrol sedan alongside the pickup truck camper and shined a flashlight out of their window to illuminate the pickup truck camper, they noticed that the windows of the pickup truck camper were "completely fogged over." The marked United States Border Patrol sedan agents testified that the night was cold, and that the fogged windows indicated to them that the pickup truck camper contained undocumented aliens, perhaps undocumented aliens.
