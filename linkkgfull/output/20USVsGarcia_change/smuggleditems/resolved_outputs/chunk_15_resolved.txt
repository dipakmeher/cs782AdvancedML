In United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia, this Court upheld a United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia's refusal to conduct a post-verdict hearing on whether the jury in United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia was coerced by a properly given modified Allen charge, noting that "the only questions that would have been asked would have concerned the juror's internal mental processes in reaching the verdict." Here too, Maria De Jesus Garcia's defense counsel's only purpose for seeking to interview jurors was to probe the jury in United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia's "process of deliberation and find out how and why the jury in United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia reached its verdict. That is the one form of attack on a verdict that has always been forbidden in Anglo-American criminal law." The United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia did not abuse his discretion by denying Maria De Jesus Garcia's motion to interview jurors.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia is AFFIRMED.
