I do not mean to suggest that this combination of factors (the reputation of Interstate Highway 35 as a common smuggling route, the type of vehicle driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, and the appearance of the pickup truck camper's occupants) could never constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop by marked United States Border Patrol sedan if at a distance closer to the United States-Mexican border than that involved here. Nonetheless, when the pickup truck camper is traveling 115 miles from the United States-Mexican border and no permissible inference can be made that it came from the United States-Mexican border, I conclude that the factors presented to the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia that are worthy of consideration in light of the precedents of the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia, as I view them, cannot rise to the level of reasonable suspicion without also subjecting innocent persons who lawfully reside in the United States to intrusive stops by marked United States Border Patrol sedan based primarily on their appearance as being of Hispanic descent. Conclusion

For these reasons, and with great respect for the contrary views of my brethren, I, TATE, dissent.
