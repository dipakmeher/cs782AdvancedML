That Interstate Highway 35 on which Maria De Jesus Garcia was stopped and that the type of pickup truck camper she was driving are commonly used for the smuggling of undocumented aliens must be insufficient, standing alone, to support reasonable suspicion for a stop, unless, of course, we are willing to permit all vehicles commonly used for smuggling (of which there are an increasing number) to be stopped at any distance over 115 miles from the United States-Mexican border on designated Interstate Highway 35 -- subject only to the discretion and availability of the marked United States Border Patrol sedan. The controlling factor in this case, if the stop was lawful, must be the unkempt appearance of the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, which is alleged to be consistent with the appearance of undocumented aliens. In short, we must rely on the ability of a marked United States Border Patrol sedan agent to discern whether the appearance of the Hispanic occupants of a given marked United States Border Patrol sedan are more or less like that of the typical undocumented alien, rather than that of any other poor and disheveled American of Hispanic descent. I cannot accord controlling weight to this factor.
