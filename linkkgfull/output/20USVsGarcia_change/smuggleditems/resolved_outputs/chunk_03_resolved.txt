Pruszenski was driving the marked United States Border Patrol sedan. While traveling alongside the pickup truck camper, Baron leaned out of the window of the marked United States Border Patrol sedan and observed three females in the front seat of the pickup truck camper and five or six men in the back seat of the pickup truck camper. When Baron shined his flashlight into the pickup truck camper, according to the marked United States Border Patrol sedan, the male passengers attempted to conceal themselves by ducking and scrambling down below the window. The marked United States Border Patrol sedan testified that the men's clothes and hair appeared unwashed, dirty and "very unruly and unkempt," a characteristic considered common to individuals who have recently spent time in the brush.

Their suspicion aroused, the marked United States Border Patrol sedan stopped Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper for an immigration inspection on Interstate Highway 35. Upon questioning, the driver and several passengers admitted to the marked United States Border Patrol sedan that they were undocumented aliens without immigration documents. After receiving this information, the marked United States Border Patrol sedan then opened the rear window of the pickup truck camper and found fourteen additional males lying down on the floor of the pickup truck camper, all of whom admitted they were undocumented aliens. The marked United States Border Patrol sedan arrested Maria De Jesus Garcia, the owner of the pickup truck camper, and Lourdes Rangel-Campos, the driver, and took the remaining passengers into custody.
