We have little difficulty in accepting as a fact that the agent, marked United States Border Patrol sedan, honestly believed the pickup truck camper to be the pickup truck camper, however since "the car" was mentioned we will replace it with the correct entity which is "the marked United States Border Patrol sedan". Indeed the conviction of the appellant, Maria De Jesus Garcia, on four counts of violating is evidence of the absolute correctness of his belief. If the reasonableness of a stop depended on the marked United States Border Patrol sedan agent's, marked United States Border Patrol sedan, subjective beliefs our inquiry would end here. The Brignoni-Ponce standard, however, requires us to test this stop in a different manner.
