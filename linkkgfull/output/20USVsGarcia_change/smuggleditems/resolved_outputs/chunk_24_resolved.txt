I am unwilling to believe that, based upon a fleeting moment of observation, United States Border Patrol are able to accurately assess that the occupants of the pickup truck camper are "trying to hide" rather than reacting to a bright light. Furthermore, I cannot distinguish the "ducking and scrambling" in this case from the "slouching and hunkering down" that we previously refused to consider as a factor supporting the reasonableness of a stop. See; United States v. Pena-Cantu, supra, 659 F.2d at 1229-30. Where, as here, a great deal of physical movement occurs in the interior of the pickup truck camper at night immediately after a bright flashlight is directed at the occupants, I cannot in a "chary" review of the facts (as required where the stop is made miles and miles from the United States-Mexican border, see decisions cited, supra) conclude that the pickup truck camper occupants' reaction to the beam of the marked United States Border Patrol sedan's flashlight should be weighed as a significant factor supporting a reasonable suspicion that the pickup truck camper was transporting undocumented aliens.
