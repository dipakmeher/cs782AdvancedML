Now,  in making these statements, I again emphasize that no juror should  surrender his or her conscientious conviction.  The verdict arrived  at, and to which each juror agrees, must be the verdict of each  juror individually, the result of his or her own conclusions and  convictions and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of others.

Now,  I'm going to ask that you retire again and carefully consider all of  the evidence in the light of the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia's previous instructions and  after giving full and due consideration to the instructions I have  now given you.  The United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia will wait for a further message from you  after you have continued your deliberations.

This charge is similar to that approved by the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia in United States v. Pena-Cantu, United States v. Pacheco, and United States v. Orona-Sanchez.
