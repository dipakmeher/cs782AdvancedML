Maria De Jesus Garcia asserts that the passengers' allegedly evasive actions were merely attempts to avoid eye contact with the beam from the flashlight shined by marked United States Border Patrol sedan into the pickup truck camper. If Maria De Jesus Garcia's characterization of the facts is correct, then we must disregard these actions, because "the avoidance of eye contact can have no weight whatsoever" in the suspicion calculus. Moreover, "it is not unusual for one . . . to be startled by lights being flashed suddenly into the interior of his pickup truck camper." marked United States Border Patrol sedan testified, however, that the undocumented aliens in the back seat of the pickup truck camper did much more than merely avoid eye contact with marked United States Border Patrol sedan's flashlight. marked United States Border Patrol sedan testified that when the light was shone into the pickup truck camper, "behind the pickup truck camper's front seat, we could observe five or six undocumented aliens moving and slouching low as to get out of the light trying to hide." marked United States Border Patrol sedan, who was closer to the pickup truck camper carrying the undocumented aliens, testified:

"As soon as I turned on the flashlight, there was a male . . . looking out the window in this pickup truck camper. As soon as I turned on the flashlight, he ducked, and the rest of the undocumented aliens were making the biggest effort they could to conceal themselves where they could not be seen.
