Another factor relied upon by the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia is also, in my view, unworthy of meaningful weight. The United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia refers to the lateness of the hour as a relevant consideration adding to reasonable suspicion. We have held, however, that a "decision to travel such roads at less busy hours should not be the difference -- constitutionally speaking -- determinative of the right of the officers to stop vehicles."

Admittedly, however, other factors relied upon by the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia perhaps do merit consideration, e.g., the previous experience of marked United States Border Patrol sedan with undocumented aliens traffic on Interstate Highway 35, the type of vehicle driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, and the unkempt appearances of the occupants of the pickup truck camper. Carefully weighing these remaining factors, I conclude that marked United States Border Patrol sedan had insufficient articulable facts to support a reasonable suspicion that the pickup truck camper was transporting undocumented aliens. Foremost among my concerns are (1) the distance between the United States-Mexican border and the point at which the stop on Interstate Highway 35 near Cotulla, Texas occurred, and (2) my hesitation to credit the ability of marked United States Border Patrol sedan to distinguish an undocumented alien from a lawful resident, based on physical appearances, after a few quick glimpses while traveling at considerable speeds on Interstate Highway 35.
