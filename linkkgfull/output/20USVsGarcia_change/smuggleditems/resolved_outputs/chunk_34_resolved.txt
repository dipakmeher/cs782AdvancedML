The modified Allen charge given here was as follows: 
"I know that you are attempting to discharge your duties in a conscientious manner. However, I want to charge you additionally at this time, that this case, United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia, like any other case, is an important case, being reviewed by the United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia. 
"Your failure to agree upon a verdict will necessitate another trial of United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia. There is nothing to indicate that it can be better tried or presented at some other time any more exhaustively than it has been by both sides of United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia during this trial. Also, you should consider that United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia at some time must be decided, and that you were selected in the same manner and from the same source from which any future jury in United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia must be selected. There is no reason to suppose that United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia will ever be submitted to a jury more intelligent, more impartial or more competent to decide it, or that more clear evidence will be produced on one side or another."
