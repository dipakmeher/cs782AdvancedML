"They were scrambling around trying to get lower than the windows were so that . . . I couldn't see them with the flashlight. They were scrambling around in the interior of the pickup truck camper there."

The United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia believed Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron's undisputed testimony on this point, and it is not challenged on appeal. (We observe that in United States v. Pacheco the panel noted that though the testimony of all four undocumented aliens implicated Maria De Jesus Garcia, one testified he slept until the marked United States Border Patrol sedan stopped, another that he "sat up normally" until it parked off the road, and "none testified that they slouched in the marked United States Border Patrol sedan in an attempt to avoid detection.")

The testimony here plainly establishes that these actions are not an instance of a reflexive attempt to avoid a bright light, but rather an obvious effort to evade detection. Cf. United States v. Pena-Cantu and United States v. Orona-Sanchez, which are relevant to the Brignoni-Ponce standard for reasonably warranting suspicion in stopping vehicles near the United States-Mexican border.
