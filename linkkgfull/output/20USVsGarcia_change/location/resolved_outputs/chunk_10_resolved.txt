"It is well settled that probable cause to search an automobile exists when trustworthy facts and circumstances within the officer's personal knowledge would cause a reasonably prudent man to believe that the vehicle contains contraband. We must also be mindful that 'probable cause is the sum total of layers of information and the synthesis of what the police have heard, what they know, and what they observed as trained officers. We weigh not individual layers but the \"laminated\" total.' (United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit) (en banc), (citations omitted).

Once several passengers of Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle admitted to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron that they were undocumented aliens, that fact, coupled with those observations suggesting that there were other individuals within the camper compartment of Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle, provided probable cause to search the camper for other illegal aliens. Thus, no violation resulted from either the stop on Interstate 35 near Cotulla, Texas or search of Maria De Jesus Garcia's vehicle, and her argument to that effect must fail.
