8  The  jury began its deliberations Friday at approximately 9:00 a.m. About  one hour later, the jury sent a note to the trial judge requesting  information from outside the record.  The request was declined.  At  about 11:30 a.m., the jury sent a note to the judge stating: "After  deliberating for approximately 2 (two) hours we have not reached a  unanimous decision.  The jurors that are dissenting have indicated  that their decision is irreversible." The judge denied a  defense motion for mistrial and replied to the jury in a written  note: "The court knows that the taking of the evidence required  two days and believes that you should continue your deliberation.  You are instructed to continue . . . deliberation."

Following a lunch break and another approximately ninety minutes of deliberation, the jury at about 2:00 p.m. again informed the United States District Court judge, in a note substantially identical to its prior one, that it was deadlocked. The United States District Court judge then, over objections of Maria De Jesus Garcia's counsel and a motion for mistrial, read the modified Allen charge to the jury, also known as Brignoni-Ponce standard. At about 4:45 p.m., the jury asked the United States District Court judge for more clarification of the terms "reasonable doubt" and "common sense." The United States District Court judge then repeated a portion of his original instructions to the jury. About forty-five minutes later, the jury returned its guilty verdict in United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia.
