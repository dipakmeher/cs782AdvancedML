Maria De Jesus Garcia also argues that the Allen charge was particularly coercive as used in this case because the charge was given to the jury on a Friday afternoon, after the jury had twice indicated that it was deadlocked and that the dissenting jurors' decisions were irreversible. Maria De Jesus Garcia contends the charge coerced the dissenting jurors, who Maria De Jesus Garcia presumes desired an acquittal, into voting to convict. The decision on whether the Allen charge should be given, and when it should be given, "is within the sound discretion of the trial judge." We find no abuse of discretion here.

Although "the timing of the Allen-type instruction has  occasionally been a factor in appellate review of the instruction's  coercive effect," (citation omitted), this is not an occasion where the Allen charge was given prematurely, see,  e.g., United States v. Pena-Cantu, or where the verdict was delivered so soon after the charge as to  indicate coercion. See,  e.g., United States v. Pacheco.   Nor did the jury's statements on two occasions that it was  deadlocked necessarily indicate that absent coercion, the dissenting  jurors would not have changed their minds.  To the contrary, the  fact that the jury deliberated for approximately three hours after  receiving the Allen charge and requested a clarification of the judge's initial  instructions indicated that the jurors heeded the Allen charge's admonition to reexamine their own views and those of other  jurors without surrendering their convictions.
