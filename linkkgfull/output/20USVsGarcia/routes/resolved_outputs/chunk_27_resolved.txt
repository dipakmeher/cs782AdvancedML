Whether a person appears "dirty" or "unkempt" varies greatly with the subjective perceptions of the person making the assessment. The standard will differ with each agent's experience and attitude about the typical appearance of an illegal alien. While I concede that this factor is worthy of some consideration, I cannot contribute controlling weight -- in the sense of the constitutionality of a stop -- to the hygienic appearances of a vehicle's occupants as interpreted by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron.
