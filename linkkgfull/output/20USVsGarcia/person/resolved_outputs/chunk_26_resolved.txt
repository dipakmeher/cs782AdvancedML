Whether a person appears "dirty" or "unkempt" varies greatly with the subjective perceptions of the person making the assessment. The standard will differ with each agent's experience and attitude about the typical appearance of an illegal alien. While I concede that this factor is worthy of some consideration, I cannot contribute controlling weight -- in the sense of the constitutionality of a stop -- to the hygienic appearances of a vehicle's occupants as interpreted by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron. 

I do not mean to suggest that this combination of factors (the reputation of the highway as a common smuggling route, the type of vehicle driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, and the appearance of Maria De Jesus Garcia, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and others) could never constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron if at a distance closer to the border than that involved here. Nonetheless, when a vehicle is traveling 115 miles from the border and no permissible inference can be made that it came from the border, I conclude that the factors presented to this court that are worthy of consideration in light of the precedents of this circuit, as I view them, cannot rise to the level of reasonable suspicion without also subjecting innocent persons who lawfully reside in this country to intrusive stops by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron based primarily on their appearance as being of Hispanic descent. Conclusion

For these reasons, and with great respect for the contrary views of my brethren, I, GARWOOD, dissent.
