Both  parties agree that because the investigatory stop in this case was  made by a roving border patrol, the legality of the stop must be  determined according to the principles articulated in .  In that decision, the Court held that   "except at the border and its functional equivalents,  officers    on roving patrol may stop vehicles only if they are aware of  specific articulable facts, together with reasonable inferences from  those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicles  contain aliens who may be illegally in the country." .   The Court stated that the following factors may be considered in  determining whether a stop is justified: characteristics of the area  in which the vehicle is encountered, including proximity to the  border, usual traffic patterns, and history of illegal alien  traffic; type and appearance of the vehicle, including whether it  appears heavily loaded; behavior of the driver; and number,  appearance, and behavior of the passengers. .  These factors are not exclusive. .  Rather, "the totality of the circumstances -- the whole picture  -- must be taken into account." . Accord, .  "Based upon that whole picture the detaining officers must have  a particularized    and objective basis for suspecting . . . the particular vehicle they  stopped was engaged in criminal activity." .  "In all situations, the officer is entitled to assess the facts  in light of his experience in detecting illegal entry and  smuggling." .
