The  essential issue facing this court today is whether roving border  patrol agents may stop persons who appear to be of Hispanic descent  and who appear to be poor and dirty, wherever and however spotted,  because those agents claim to have the "expertise" to  distinguish between the characteristics of those travelers who are  illegal aliens and those who are lawfully present in the United  States.  Quite unfortunately, we have the opportunity only to review  the successful guesses of these agents; we are never presented with  the unconstitutionally intrusive stops of Hispanic residents and  citizens that do not result in an arrest.  Differentiating the  United States from police states of past history and the present,  our Constitution in its prohibition against unreasonable searches protects all our  residents, whether middle-class and well-dressed or poor and  disheveled, from arbitrary stop by governmental enforcement agents  in our travel upon the highways of this nation.
