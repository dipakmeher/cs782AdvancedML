A  factor affecting the lawfulness of a stop should not rest on the  subtleties of the difference, if indeed there is one, between  "ducking and scrambling" and "slouching and hunkering  down." The essence of the majority's distinction unfortunately  rests not on the physical actions of the occupants of the truck,  which can be observed by border patrol agents, but on the motives  for which the occupants took those physical actions (their desire to  hide), something which could not be observed by the agents.  The  "undisputed" testimony of the agents was that this  "ducking and scrambling" took place immediately after they  had shined their flashlight into the dark cabin of the truck. The  physical reactions of the occupants may have been a response to the  beam of the flashlight, a circumstance which the majority concedes  would render their conduct irrelevant. See (finding that "reasonable suspicion should not turn on the  ophthalmological reactions of the appellant").  Of course, the  agents here also testified that an additional motive    of the occupants' actions (beyond reacting to the light) was "to  conceal themselves" so as to avoid detection.
