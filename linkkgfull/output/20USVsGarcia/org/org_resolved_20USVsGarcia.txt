Maria De Jesus Garcia is a Defendant.

GARWOOD, Circuit Judge:

This appeal is brought by Maria De Jesus Garcia, who was convicted by a jury in the United States District Court trial of four counts of aiding and abetting the transportation of undocumented aliens in violation of and. Maria De Jesus Garcia alleges that the United States District Court judge erred in refusing to suppress evidence which Maria De Jesus Garcia says was obtained by the United States Government as a result of an unconstitutional stop on Interstate Highway 35 and search of pickup truck camper. Maria De Jesus Garcia also challenges the United States District Court judge's reading of a modified Allen charge to the jury in the United States District Court trial, and the judge's refusal to allow post-trial interviews of jurors by defense counsel.

THE STOP AND SEARCH

On February 18, 1983, United States Border Patrol agents Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron were sitting in their marked United States Border Patrol sedan overlooking the northbound lanes of Interstate Highway 35 just south of Moore, Texas about 115 miles from the United States-Mexican border. At approximately 11:30 p.m., Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron spotted a pickup truck camper traveling northbound unusually slowly, its headlights angled up. The United States Border Patrol agents entered traffic to further observe the pickup truck camper. They saw that its bumper was low, its tires "were squashed down," the wheel wells were covering part of the tires, and it was loaded heavily in the rear. The pickup truck camper was weaving, it appearing "that the driver was having a hard time controlling the pickup truck camper due to the weight in the back, making the front end light." When the United States Border Patrol agents pulled their car alongside the pickup truck camper and shined a flashlight out of their window to illuminate the pickup truck camper, they noticed that the windows of the pickup truck camper were "completely fogged over." The United States Border Patrol agents testified that the night was cold, and that the fogged windows indicated to them that the pickup truck camper contained living beings, perhaps people.

Pruszenski was driving the United States Border Patrol's patrol car. While traveling alongside the pickup truck camper, Baron leaned out of the window of the patrol car and observed three females in the front seat of the pickup truck camper and five or six men in the back seat of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper. When Baron shined his flashlight into the pickup truck camper, according to the United States Border Patrol, the male passengers attempted to conceal themselves by ducking and scrambling down below the window. The United States Border Patrol testified that the men's clothes and hair appeared unwashed, dirty and "very unruly and unkempt," a characteristic considered common to individuals who have recently spent time in the brush.

Their suspicion aroused, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, as agents of the United States Border Patrol, stopped the pickup truck camper for an immigration inspection on Interstate Highway 35. Upon questioning, the driver and several passengers admitted to the United States Border Patrol that they were Mexican citizens without immigration documents. After receiving this information, the United States Border Patrol then opened the rear window to the pickup truck camper and found fourteen additional males lying down on the floor, all of whom admitted they were illegal aliens. The United States Border Patrol arrested Maria De Jesus Garcia, the owner of the pickup truck camper, and Lourdes Rangel-Campos, the driver, and took the remaining passengers into custody.

Before trial, defense counsel moved to suppress evidence obtained by the United States Government as a result of the stop and search of pickup truck camper. Defense counsel also moved to extend the deadline for filing the suppression motion, which had already passed. Although the United States District Court in pickup truck camper's case denied the extension motion, it allowed pickup truck camper at pickup truck camper's trial to present evidence pertinent to the suppression motion, and made oral findings of fact regarding the constitutionality of the stop on Interstate Highway 35 and search, concluding that they were proper. The United States Government on appeal waives any objection to the timeliness of pickup truck camper's suppression motion, and we consider it on its merits.

To justify the suppression of evidence in this case, we must consider first, whether there was a sufficient basis to stop pickup truck camper, and second, whether there was probable cause to permit the subsequent search of the pickup truck camper.

Both parties agree that because the investigatory stop on Interstate Highway 35 in this case was made by roving United States Border Patrol agents, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, the legality of the stop on Interstate Highway 35 must be determined according to the principles articulated in Brignoni-Ponce standard. In that decision, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals held that "except at the United States-Mexican border and its functional equivalents, officers on roving patrol may stop vehicles only if they are aware of specific articulable facts, together with reasonable inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicles contain aliens who may be illegally in the United States." The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals stated that the following factors may be considered in determining whether a stop is justified: characteristics of the area covered by the Cotulla, Texas Border Patrol Station in which the pickup truck camper is encountered, including proximity to the United States-Mexican border, usual traffic patterns on Interstate Highway 35, and history of illegal alien traffic; type and appearance of pickup truck camper, including whether it appears heavily loaded; behavior of the driver; and number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers. These factors are not exclusive. Rather, "the totality of the circumstances -- the whole picture -- must be taken into account." Accord, Orona-Sanchez case, Lamas case, Pacheco case, Pena-Cantu case. "Based upon that whole picture Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, the detaining United States Border Patrol officers, must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting . . . the particular pickup truck camper they stopped was engaged in criminal activity." "In all situations, the United States Border Patrol officer is entitled to assess the facts in light of his experience in detecting illegal entry and smuggling in Texas."

This Court has repeatedly stated that a vital element of the Brignoni-Ponce standard is whether the agent had "reason to believe that the pickup truck camper in question had come from the United States-Mexican border." (citations omitted). "We have found this element . . . missing where the stop has occurred a substantial distance from the United States-Mexican border." Id. See, e.g., (sixty miles from the United States-Mexican border); (on Interstate Highway 35, eighty-five miles from the United States-Mexican border); (fifty-five miles from the United States-Mexican border).

In this case, Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper was stopped more than 100 miles from the United States-Mexican border, and neither Stanley Pruszenski nor Alfred Baron testified that they had any reason to believe the pickup truck camper had crossed the United States-Mexican border when they stopped it. Although Interstate Highway 35 leads directly to the United States-Mexican border, it passes through the city of Laredo, Texas and some seven other towns before reaching Moore. "The mere fact that a pickup truck camper is proceeding on a public highway leading from the United States-Mexican border but already past towns in this country is not sufficient cause to believe the pickup truck camper came from the United States-Mexican border."

Although we find that United States Border Patrol did not have sufficient information to reasonably suspect that pickup truck camper came from the United States-Mexican border, the Brignoni-Ponce standard may still be satisfied "if other articulable facts 'reasonably warrant suspicion.'" We are required, however, to examine these facts charily. After a careful review of the record, we note that many of the factors deemed relevant in Brignoni-Ponce and its progeny are present in this case.

Baron testified without contradiction that United States Border Patrol agents had recently apprehended a number of illegal alien smugglers at or near the location of the instant stop where he and Pruszenski were stationed on February 28, and the evidence plainly supports the United States District Court's unassailed findings that Interstate Highway 35, as well as other highways also leading to the United States-Mexican border that intersect it just south of where the agents initially observed the pickup truck camper, are Interstate Highway 35 and other highways. See ; ; (per curiam). The evidence also adequately supports the United States District Court's unchallenged finding that the United States Border Patrol agents knew that pickup truck campers are used frequently for transporting illegal aliens. See ; (pickup truck camper); (stake bed truck with concealed compartment). The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals also has relied upon a United States Border Patrol agent's observation, as was present here, that occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper were unwashed and unkempt. See . Moreover, the lateness of the hour substantially reduces the likelihood that those individuals were returning from outdoor work. These facts, coupled with those occupants' sudden, extensive, and active attempts to position themselves so as to evade detection, gave reason for United States Border Patrol agents Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron to suspect the presence of illegal aliens in Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper. Moreover, the United States Border Patrol agents had reason to believe that the pickup truck camper contained a sizable living cargo: the pickup truck camper appeared heavily loaded, see ; (per curiam); (cases cited), and its windows were completely fogged over. See (10th Cir.), .

Without determining whether any of these factors is alone dispositive, we hold that United States Border Patrol, considering the totality of the circumstances -- including the unusually heavy and overloaded appearance of pickup truck camper, the fogged windows, the history of alien smuggling on Interstate Highway 35 just above these other connecting roads to the United States-Mexican border, the unwashed and very unkempt appearance of the occupants, their efforts to avoid detection by ducking and scrambling, the late hour, and the unusually slow speed of pickup truck camper -- in light of their specialized experience and training, reasonably could have an objective and particularized suspicion that pickup truck camper was then transporting illegal aliens. We therefore conclude that the stop of that pickup truck camper did not violate the.

Once pickup truck camper was stopped, the United States Border Patrol were entitled to question its occupants about their citizenship and immigration status, "but any further detention or search . . . required probable cause."

"It is well settled that probable cause to search an automobile exists when trustworthy facts and circumstances within the officer's personal knowledge would cause a reasonably prudent man to believe that the pickup truck camper contains contraband. We must also be mindful that 'probable cause is the sum total of layers of information and the synthesis of what the police have heard, what they know, and what they observed as trained officers. We weigh not individual layers but the \"laminated\" total.' (5th Circuit Court of Appeals) (en banc), (citations omitted).

Once several passengers of pickup truck camper admitted to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron that they were undocumented aliens, that fact, coupled with those observations suggesting that there were other individuals within the pickup truck camper, provided probable cause to search the pickup truck camper for other illegal aliens. Thus, no violation resulted from either the stop on Interstate Highway 35 or search of pickup truck camper, and her argument to that effect must fail.

THE ALLEN CHARGE

pickup truck camper launches a two-pronged attack against the modified Allen charge given to the jury in pickup truck camper's trial. First, she argues that use of any form of the Allen charge is coercive and thus violates the right to a fair trial. Second, she contends that the Allen charge, even if not inherently prejudicial, was unduly coercive in the context of this case."

At the outset, we note that "it is well settled in this circuit that the Allen charge is permissible, within the limitations of our prior decisions." (footnote omitted). Maria De Jesus Garcia does not attack the language of the Allen charge used below, which "was well within these limitations."

In United States v. Garcia, aff'd en banc, 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a general attack on the Allen charge as being inherently coercive in any form. Id., 468 F.2d at 661, 480 F.2d at 518. Accord, United States v. Garcia. "5th Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly upheld the use of the modified Allen charge." Unless sitting en banc, 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is bound by the prior decisions of 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Maria De Jesus Garcia also argues that the Allen charge was particularly coercive as used in this case because the charge was given to jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial on a Friday afternoon, after jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial had twice indicated that it was deadlocked and that the dissenting jurors' decisions were irreversible. Maria De Jesus Garcia contends the charge coerced the dissenting jurors, who Maria De Jesus Garcia presumes desired an acquittal, into voting to convict. The decision on whether the Allen charge should be given, and when it should be given, "is within the sound discretion of United States District Court." 5th Circuit Court of Appeals finds no abuse of discretion here.

Although "the timing of the Allen-type instruction has  occasionally been a factor in appellate review of the instruction's  coercive effect," (citation omitted), this is not an occasion where the Allen charge was given prematurely, see,  e.g., ,  or where the verdict was delivered so soon after the charge as to  indicate coercion. See,  e.g., .   Nor did the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial's statements on two occasions that it was  deadlocked necessarily indicate that absent coercion, the dissenting  jurors would not have changed their minds.  To the contrary, the  fact that the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial deliberated for approximately three hours after  receiving the Allen charge and requested a clarification of the judge's initial  instructions indicated that the jurors heeded the Allen charge's admonition to reexamine their own views and those of other  jurors without surrendering their convictions.

Because  we do not believe the carefully worded Allen charge given to the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial unduly coerced, threatened, or pressured  dissenting jurors into surrendering    their conscientiously held views, see (per curiam),  ,  we hold use of the charge in this case was proper. Cf. .

QUESTIONING  OF JURORS

Maria De Jesus Garcia's final contention is that the United States District Court erred in refusing to allow her to conduct post-verdict "discovery" through juror depositions and interrogatories in order to determine whether the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial were coerced by the Allen charge.

"Historically, interrogations of jurors have not been favored by federal courts except where there is some showing of illegal or prejudicial intrusion into the jury process." , (emphasis in original). Accord, . The only intrusion alleged here was the giving of the Allen charge to the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial, which the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has held was not error. That is not the type of "illegal or prejudicial intrusion into the jury process" that might justify post-verdict interviews of jurors.

In United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a United States District Court's refusal to conduct a post-verdict hearing on whether the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial was coerced by a properly given Allen charge, noting that "the only questions that would have been asked would have concerned the juror's internal mental processes in reaching the verdict." Here too, defense counsel's only purpose for seeking to interview jurors was to probe the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial's "process of deliberation and find out how and why the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial reached its verdict. That is the one form of attack on a verdict that has always been forbidden in Anglo-American criminal law." The United States District Court did not abuse his discretion by denying Maria De Jesus Garcia's motion to interview jurors.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United States District Court is AFFIRMED.

Dissent by: Judge TATE

Dissent
Judge TATE, Circuit Judge, dissenting:

A pickup truck camper was stopped at about 11:30 p.m. by United States Border Patrol on Interstate Highway 35 in Texas some 115 miles north of the United States-Mexican border. So far as United States Border Patrol were able to glimpse, there were three women in the front seat of pickup truck camper and five or six men in the back seat of pickup truck camper. To pickup truck camper was affixed a heavily loaded pickup truck camper. The essential issue concerns the lawfulness or not of the stop of pickup truck camper. Believing that, stripped to its essence, the stop was based upon no more than United States Border Patrol's speculation that poor and dirty Hispanic appearing persons might possibly be Mexican aliens who had crossed the United States-Mexican border illegally some 115 miles south of the stop, and that "reasonable suspicion" of illegal alien entry cannot be based upon the mere circumstance that a crowded pickup truck camper of dirty appearing Hispanic-descended workmen is traveling on Interstate Highway 35 at 11:30 in the evening, I, Judge TATE, must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion, which, I concede, is excellent and thorough and has fairly presented the factual picture.

The essential issue facing the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals today is whether roving United States Border Patrol agents, such as Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, may stop persons who appear to be of Hispanic descent and who appear to be poor and dirty, wherever and however spotted, because those agents claim to have the "expertise" to distinguish between the characteristics of those travelers who are illegal aliens and those who are lawfully present in the United States. Quite unfortunately, we have the opportunity only to review the successful guesses of these agents; we are never presented with the unconstitutionally intrusive stops of Hispanic residents and citizens that do not result in an arrest. Differentiating the United States from police states of past history and the present, our Constitution in its prohibition against unreasonable searches protects all our residents, whether middle-class and well-dressed or poor and disheveled, from arbitrary stop by United States Government enforcement agents, such as Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, in our travel upon the highways of the United States.

The perceived social problem in controlling the hordes of illegal migrants from Mexico, does not, in my opinion, justify stopping people of Hispanic-descent appearance far from the United States-Mexican border, simply because the hour is late and they appear to be poor and dirty working people, any more than it would justify the similar arbitrary stop of any native-born or naturalized American simply because he has the same characteristics of appearance. A few of the decisions of the United States District Court that have upheld stops by United States Border Patrol agents have come perilously close to ignoring this fundamental constitutional concept, in relying upon one slight circumstance or another, in conjunction with the totality of its context, as entitling these United States Border Patrol agents to a stop-justifying "reasonable" suspicion. In the present instance, based upon an addition of some slight circumstances relied upon in these other scattered decisions, not of themselves sufficient (out of their context) to justify reasonable suspicion, the majority nevertheless finds the stop justified, although in the present context these circumstances do not add up to reasons justifying reasonable suspicion of illegal entry.

To its credit, the panel majority has tried to apply the precedents of this circuit in a principled way to the present facts. I am afraid, however, that this attempt has only succeeded in differentiating otherwise irreconcilable precedent of this circuit through an unsteady calculus of what factors may permissibly be considered when determining whether United States Border Patrol agents have an objectively "reasonable suspicion" to make a stop. With great respect for the views of my brethren in the majority, I must dissent.

II.

The majority correctly notes that this stop by a roving United States Border Patrol requires the application of the multi-factorial test of. Accordingly, we must assess the lawfulness of the stop in light of the totality of the circumstances known to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron at the time of the stop. A vital element of this test is whether the agent who made the stop had "reason to believe that the pickup truck camper in question had come from the border." Maria De Jesus Garcia was stopped on Interstate Highway 35 in Texas 115 miles north of the United States-Mexican border. As the majority candidly admits, nothing in this case suggests that Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron had any reason to believe that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper had come from the United States-Mexican border.

In the absence of an inference that the pickup truck camper to be stopped came from the United States-Mexican border, the remaining factors known to the United States Border Patrol must be carefully examined to determine whether "other articulable facts 'reasonably warrant suspicion'". In the present case, the remaining factors relied upon by the majority included: other illegal aliens had been seized near the location of the instant stop where the United States Border Patrol encountered Maria De Jesus Garcia; the interstate highway on which Maria De Jesus Garcia was traveling was "a common smuggling route"; the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper were unwashed and unkempt; the type of pickup truck camper driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, a pickup truck camper, is often used to transport illegal aliens; the windows of the pickup truck camper appeared to be fogged, suggesting that the pickup truck camper carried living cargo; the lateness of the hour at the time of the stop on Interstate Highway 35; the scrambling of the occupants of the pickup truck camper when Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron shined their flashlight at them; the seemingly heavy load in Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper; the speed of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper; and the specialized training of United States Border Patrol involved in the stop on Interstate Highway 35. Because I believe that the consideration of several of these factors departs from the precedents of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, despite the majority's distinguishment of them as not controlling, and that the remaining factors cannot, standing alone, support the stop of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, I cannot join the opinion of the panel majority, excellently reasoned as it is.

The majority notes that a relevant consideration in its analysis was the apparent heavy load carried by pickup truck camper. Although we have been loath to give any weight to the "heavy load" factor in the past, see (stop held illegal, under facts quite similar to the present); , the majority offers the distinction that "here, by contrast, the testimony reflects a degree of loading that is more than merely heavy, but is indeed over loading." (Maj. op. at 1225 n. 2)

As an initial matter, the distinction between "heavy-loading" and "overloading" is dubious and more semantic than real. More importantly, however, the rejection of "heavy" or "over" -loading as a factor rests on considerations of substance, not of degree. The factor is irrelevant as a consideration to support reasonable suspicion because a "heavy load" is just as consistent with innocent conduct, e.g., a heavy load of produce or livestock, as it is with culpable conduct, e.g., smuggling illegal aliens, especially when we cannot infer that the pickup truck camper in question had come from the United States-Mexican border.

We have also refused to accord weight to the observations of United States Border Patrol agents that a pickup truck camper's occupants "hunkered down" when the agents passed or were sitting low so as to avoid detection, see Orona-Sanchez case, or that the occupants of a pickup truck camper were startled by the beam of a United States Border Patrol agent's flashlight. The majority reasons that these decisions are inapposite since the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper "did much more than merely avoid eye contact with Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron's flashlight." (Maj. op. at 1224 n. 1). United States Border Patrol testified that the occupants were "moving and slouching low as to get out of the light trying to hide." United States Border Patrol testified that, after he shined his flashlight into Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, "they were scrambling around trying to get lower than the windows were so that . . . I couldn't see them with a flashlight. They were scrambling around in the pickup truck camper." The majority considered this testimony relevant since "ducking and scrambling around is certainly less typical of innocent passengers than slouching or hunkering down." (Maj. op. at 1225).

A factor affecting the lawfulness of a stop should not rest on the subtleties of the difference, if indeed there is one, between "ducking and scrambling" and "slouching and hunkering down." The essence of the majority's distinction unfortunately rests not on the physical actions of the occupants of pickup truck camper, which can be observed by United States Border Patrol and United States Border Patrol, but on the motives for which the occupants took those physical actions (their desire to hide), something which could not be observed by United States Border Patrol and United States Border Patrol. The "undisputed" testimony of United States Border Patrol and United States Border Patrol was that this "ducking and scrambling" took place immediately after they had shined their flashlight into the dark cabin of pickup truck camper. The physical reactions of Maria De Jesus Garcia, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and others may have been a response to the beam of the flashlight, a circumstance which the majority concedes would render their conduct irrelevant. See (finding that "reasonable suspicion should not turn on the ophthalmological reactions of Maria De Jesus Garcia"). Of course, United States Border Patrol and United States Border Patrol here also testified that an additional motive of the occupants' actions (beyond reacting to the light) was "to conceal themselves" so as to avoid detection.

I am unwilling to believe that, based upon a fleeting moment of observation, United States Border Patrol agents Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron are able to accurately assess that the occupants of pickup truck camper are "trying to hide" rather than reacting to a bright light. Furthermore, I cannot distinguish the "ducking and scrambling" in this case from the "slouching and hunkering down" that we previously refused to consider as a factor supporting the reasonableness of a stop. See Pena-Cantu case, supra, 659 F.2d at 1229-30. Where, as here, a great deal of physical movement occurs in the pickup truck camper at night immediately after a bright flashlight is directed at the occupants, I cannot in a "chary" review of the facts (as required where the stop is made miles and miles from the United States-Mexican border, see decisions cited, supra) conclude that pickup truck camper, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and others' reaction to the beam of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron's flashlight should be weighed as a significant factor supporting a reasonable suspicion that pickup truck camper was transporting aliens.

Another factor relied upon by the majority is also, in my view, unworthy of meaningful weight. The United States District Court refers to the lateness of the hour as a relevant consideration adding to reasonable suspicion. We have held, however, that a "decision to travel such roads at less busy hours should not be the difference -- constitutionally speaking -- determinative of the right of the United States Border Patrol to stop vehicles."

Admittedly, however, other factors relied upon by the majority perhaps do merit consideration, e.g., the previous experience of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron with illegal alien traffic on Interstate Highway 35, the type of pickup truck camper driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, and the unkempt appearances of Maria De Jesus Garcia, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and others. Carefully weighing these remaining factors, I conclude that United States Border Patrol had insufficient articulable facts to support a reasonable suspicion that the pickup truck camper driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia was transporting illegal aliens. Foremost among my concerns are (1) the distance between the United States-Mexican border and the point at which the stop occurred, and (2) my hesitation to credit the ability of United States Border Patrol to distinguish an illegal alien from a lawful resident, based on physical appearances, after a few quick glimpses while traveling at considerable speeds on Interstate Highway 35.

That Interstate Highway 35 on which Maria De Jesus Garcia was stopped and that the type of pickup truck camper she was driving are commonly used for the smuggling of aliens must be insufficient, standing alone, to support reasonable suspicion for a stop, unless, of course, we are willing to permit all vehicles commonly used for smuggling (of which there are an increasing number) to be stopped at any distance over 115 miles from the United States-Mexican border on designated highways -- subject only to the discretion and availability of United States Border Patrol. The controlling factor in this case, if the stop was lawful, must be the unkempt appearance of Maria De Jesus Garcia, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and others, which is alleged to be consistent with the appearance of illegal aliens. In short, we must rely on the ability of United States Border Patrol to discern whether the appearance of the Hispanic occupants of a given pickup truck camper are more or less like that of the typical illegal alien, rather than that of any other poor and disheveled American of Hispanic descent. I cannot accord controlling weight to this factor.

Whether a person appears "dirty" or "unkempt" varies greatly with the subjective perceptions of the person making the assessment. The standard will differ with each agent's experience and attitude about the typical appearance of an illegal alien. While I concede that this factor is worthy of some consideration, I cannot contribute controlling weight -- in the sense of the constitutionality of a stop -- to the hygienic appearances of a pickup truck camper's occupants as interpreted by United States Border Patrol and United States Border Patrol.

I do not mean to suggest that this combination of factors (the reputation of Interstate Highway 35 as a common smuggling route, the type of pickup truck camper driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, and the appearance of Maria De Jesus Garcia, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and others) could never constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop by United States Border Patrol if at a distance closer to the United States-Mexican border than that involved here. Nonetheless, when a pickup truck camper is traveling 115 miles from the United States-Mexican border and no permissible inference can be made that it came from the United States-Mexican border, I conclude that the factors presented to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that are worthy of consideration in light of the precedents of this circuit, as I view them, cannot rise to the level of reasonable suspicion without also subjecting innocent persons who lawfully reside in the United States to intrusive stops by United States Border Patrol based primarily on their appearance as being of Hispanic descent. Conclusion

For these reasons, and with great respect for the contrary views of my brethren, I, GARWOOD, dissent.

E nd  of Document

Maria De Jesus Garcia asserts that the passengers' allegedly evasive actions were merely attempts to avoid eye contact with the beam from the flashlight shined by Alfred Baron into the pickup truck camper. If Maria De Jesus Garcia's characterization of the facts is correct, then we must disregard these actions, because "the avoidance of eye contact can have no weight whatsoever" in the suspicion calculus. Moreover, "it is not unusual for one . . . to be startled by lights being flashed suddenly into the interior of his pickup truck camper." United States Border Patrol testified, however, that the passengers in the back seat of the pickup truck camper did much more than merely avoid eye contact with Alfred Baron's flashlight. United States Border Patrol testified that when the light was shone into the pickup truck camper, "behind the pickup truck camper's front seat, we could observe five or six people moving and slouching low as to get out of the light trying to hide." United States Border Patrol, who was closer to the pickup truck camper carrying the aliens, testified:

As soon as I turned on the flashlight, there was a male . . . looking out the window in this pickup truck camper. As soon as I turned on the flashlight, he ducked, and the rest of the men were making the biggest effort they could to conceal themselves where they could not be seen.

They were scrambling around trying to get lower than the windows were so that . . . I couldn't see them with the flashlight. They were scrambling around in the pickup truck camper.

The United States District Court in Maria De Jesus Garcia's case believed Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron's undisputed testimony on this point, and it is not challenged on appeal. (We observe that in Pacheco case the panel noted that though the testimony of all four aliens implicated Maria De Jesus Garcia, one testified he slept until the pickup truck camper stopped, another that he "sat up normally" until it parked off the road, and "none testified that they slouched in the pickup truck camper in an attempt to avoid detection.". )

The testimony here plainly establishes that these actions are not an instance of a reflexive attempt to avoid a bright light, but rather an obvious effort to evade detection. Cf.

That some of the passengers "were sitting low" was held insufficient to justify the stop in Orona-Sanchez case. Such a static condition is one common to pickup truck camper passengers. The same ruling was made in Orona-Sanchez case, 648 F.2d at 1041-42, respecting the circumstance that, between the time the pickup truck camper initially drove by the then stationary agents and the time the agents later caught up with and passed it, two of the passengers "had 'sort of slouched down'" so only the tops of their heads were visible to the passing agents. However, it was after dark and that character of change over several minutes to a more recumbent position by nighttime passengers is not unusual. Moreover, in Orona-Sanchez case we gave "substantial weight to the fact that these agents were new to the area . . . ." Id. at 1042. In Lamas case, we held the fact that "passengers in the back seat appeared to slouch down" as the pickup truck camper passed the agents, while "certainly a suspicious reaction," was nevertheless not "on its own sufficient" to justify the stop. In Pacheco case we made the same holding respecting similar testimony that the passengers "'hunkered down' in the seat." While the passenger conduct in Lamas case and Pacheco case is more suspicious than that in Pena-Cantu case and Orona-Sanchez case, it is clearly less suspicious than the more extensive, active, abrupt, and obviously evasive conduct described by the agents here. Ducking and scrambling around is certainly less typical of innocent passengers than slouching or hunkering down. Cf. e.g., (distinguishing Orona-Sanchez case and Pacheco case). Because "each case must turn on the totality of the particular circumstances" in that case, 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, while we consider the clearly evasive actions of the passengers in Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper as a significant factor in justifying the stop on Interstate Highway 35, we need not determine whether it alone would suffice, other factors also being present here.

2. In. Here, by contrast, the testimony reflects a degree of loading that is more than merely "heavy" but is indeed obvious overloading (e.g., not only low in the rear, but to the extent that the pickup truck camper weaves and headlights are noticeably angled up) -- consistent with the some twenty-two people carried by pickup truck camper. Moreover, Pacheco case and Orona-Sanchez case are also distinguishable from the case at hand, in that the weaving and lowered rear of the pickup truck camper and the fogged windows of the pickup truck camper here indicated not only that the pickup truck camper carried a most unusually heavy cargo, but that the cargo was breathing.

4. Pickup truck camper was traveling at forty to forty-five miles per hour. Alfred Baron testified that it was unusual for vehicles to be traveling late at night at such a slow speed on that portion of Interstate Highway 35. Cf.;

5  United States Border Patrol each had received specialized training as United States Border Patrol agents, following which they served as United States Border Patrol in the area, including the location of the instant stop, covered by the Cotulla, Texas station, United States Border Patrol for a period of two years and five months, and United States Border Patrol for slightly over three years, prior to the events in question. During this period of service, United States Border Patrol had participated in approximately 150 separate incidents in which arrests were made for transporting illegal aliens, and United States Border Patrol had received training in Spanish, and spoke and understood it to a limited extent. United States Border Patrol was a native Spanish speaker. As noted supra, we must consider the facts known to the United States Border Patrol in light of the United States Border Patrol's professional experience. See, e.g..

6 However, if the stop on Interstate Highway 35 were lawful and if United States Border Patrol had probable cause to believe that Maria De Jesus Garcia was carrying illegal aliens, no warrant was required for their search of pickup truck camper.

7 The Allen charge given here was as follows:

"I know that you are attempting to discharge your duties in a conscientious manner. However, I want to charge you additionally at this time, that this, like any other case, is an important case."

"Your failure to agree upon a verdict will necessitate another trial. There is nothing to indicate that it can be better tried or presented at some other time any more exhaustively than it has been by both sides of the case during this trial. Also, you should consider that the case at some time must be decided, and that you were selected in the same manner and from the same source from which any future jury must be selected. There is no reason to suppose that the case will ever be submitted to a jury more intelligent, more impartial or more competent to decide it, or that more clear evidence will be produced on one side or another."

Now, it is your duty to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so. However, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals does not want any juror to surrender his or her conscientious conviction. Each juror should perform his or her duty conscientiously and honestly according to the law and the evidence, although the verdict to which the jurors agree, of course, must be his or her own verdict, the result of his or her own convictions, and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusions of other jurors. Yet, in order to bring twelve minds -- in your case, ten minds -- to a unanimous result, you must consider the matters submitted to you with candor and with a proper regard for and deference to the opinions of others. Thus, in conferring together, you ought to pay proper respect to each other's opinions with an open-minded disposition to be convinced by each other's arguments. You should not, any of you, adopt a stubborn, close-minded attitude toward your responsibilities here. It is important that you should arrive at a verdict one way or the other, but only, of course, according to your convictions. You must not, by reason of having taken a position at one time or another in the discussions, stubbornly adhere to that position without listening carefully to the others and reexamining your own views, as well as the suggestions and ideas expressed by the other jurors, keeping in view the ultimate goal of reaching a verdict in which you can conscientiously join. This is very important, and I urge that you give full consideration to the matters which I have suggested.

"Now,  in making these statements, I again emphasize that no juror should  surrender his or her conscientious conviction.  The verdict arrived  at, and to which each juror agrees, must be the verdict of each  juror individually, the result of his or her own conclusions and  convictions and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of others.

Now,  I'm going to ask that you retire again and carefully consider all of  the evidence in the light of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals's previous instructions and  after giving full and due consideration to the instructions I have  now given you.  The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will wait for a further message from you  after you have continued your deliberations.

This charge is similar to that approved by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in ,  ."

8  The jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial began its deliberations Friday at approximately 9:00 a.m. About one hour later, the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial sent a note to the United States District Court requesting information from outside the record. The request was declined. At about 11:30 a.m., the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial sent a note to the United States District Court stating: "After deliberating for approximately 2 (two) hours we have not reached a unanimous decision. The jurors that are dissenting have indicated that their decision is irreversible." The United States District Court denied a defense motion for mistrial and replied to the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial in a written note: "The United States District Court knows that the taking of the evidence required two days and believes that you should continue your deliberation. You are instructed to continue . . . deliberation."

Following a lunch break and another approximately ninety minutes of deliberation, the jury in pickup truck camper's trial at about 2:00 p.m. again informed the United States District Court, in a note substantially identical to its prior one, that it was deadlocked. The United States District Court then, over objections of pickup truck camper's counsel and a motion for mistrial, read the modified Allen charge to the jury in pickup truck camper's trial. At about 4:45 p.m., the jury in pickup truck camper's trial asked the United States District Court for more clarification of the terms "reasonable doubt" and "common sense." The United States District Court then repeated a portion of his original instructions to the jury in pickup truck camper's trial. About forty-five minutes later, the jury in pickup truck camper's trial returned its guilty verdict.

9 In denying pickup truck camper's motion for post-verdict discovery, the United States District Court relied primarily on the fact "that any information pickup truck camper might obtain from jurors in pickup truck camper's trial through 'discovery' would be inadmissible under," which reads:

Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury in pickup truck camper's trial's deliberations or to the effect of anything upon his or any other juror's mind or emotions as influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict . . . or concerning his mental processes in connection therewith, except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury in pickup truck camper's trial's attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror. Nor may his affidavit or evidence of any statement by him concerning a matter about which he would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.

"A valid argument may be made that any post-trial questioning of jurors in pickup truck camper's trial (for the purpose of impeaching the verdict) should be . . . restricted to those matters found by the United States District Court in Maria De Jesus Garcia's case as both relevant and proper under" . .  On appeal, pickup truck camper appears to concede the applicability of to her request for post-trial questioning of jurors in pickup truck camper's trial, but claims the rule is overbroad.  We find this contention to be without merit here.

1. Other factors also persuade the majority of the relevance of the heavy-load factor, such as the squashed tires of pickup truck camper, the angle upward of pickup truck camper's headlights, the slow speed of pickup truck camper, and the weaving of pickup truck camper. While it is true that a heavy truck may have squashed tires and angled headlights and be difficult to maneuver, these facts have no bearing on the basic principle that operating a heavily loaded truck is no more consistent with guilty conduct than it is with innocent conduct. It is also possible, of course, that the tires may have been under-inflated and that the headlights were improperly aligned, indicating the questionable relevance of these factors when viewed "charily", as our precedents require.

2. Under the circumstances of this case, I can attribute no weight to **United States Border Patrol**'s observance that the windows of the camper shell on pickup truck camper appeared to be fogged. Under a cautious view of the facts I simply cannot infer that the appearance of a fogged window on a cold night would be caused solely by living, breathing cargo. Even if I were to accept that inference, I cannot find any basis for the further conclusion that the living cargo was human and illegally attempting to enter the **United States**.

3  The  majority notes that all of the relevant factors must be viewed in  light of the specialized experience and training of the United States Border Patrol agents, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron.  To the extent that the experience of these United States Border Patrol agents contributes to the assessment of particular highways as smuggling  routes and particular vehicles as common modes of transporting  aliens, it is indeed a factor which we must consider. See .  On the other hand, the subjective knowledge or beliefs of the United States Border Patrol agent can add nothing to our objective determination of  whether the United States Border Patrol agents had reasonable cause to stop the pickup truck camper, Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper.  As we  stated in ,

We  have little difficulty in accepting as a fact that the United States Border Patrol agents honestly believed the pickup truck camper to be carrying illegal aliens. Indeed the  conviction of the appellant, Maria De Jesus Garcia, on four counts of violating is evidence of the absolute correctness of their belief.  If the  reasonableness of a stop depended on the United States Border Patrol agents' subjective beliefs our inquiry would end here.  The Brignoni-Ponce standard,  however, requires us to test this stop in a different manner.

See also. Thus, I am unable to derive any support for the stop on Interstate Highway 35 from the majority's description of the expertise of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, the United States Border Patrol, or their ability to speak Spanish. These facts do not enhance the other facts relied upon by the majority, nor do they persuade me of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron's superior ability to distinguish illegal aliens from lawful residents -- at least without evidence showing the number of erroneous stops made by these same United States Border Patrol.
