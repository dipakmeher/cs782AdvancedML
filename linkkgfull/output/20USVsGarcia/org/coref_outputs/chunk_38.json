    "United States District Court": "Court where trial was held and made oral findings of fact regarding the constitutionality of a stop and search, applying the Brignoni-Ponce standard; exercised discretion in giving the Allen charge; believed Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron's undisputed testimony. The court also handled jury deliberations and requests for information from outside the record in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial, and provided additional clarification on 'reasonable doubt' and 'common sense' to the jury."
