    "United States District Court": "Court handling post-trial procedures, determining the relevance and propriety of juror questioning, and making decisions on stops by immigration agents. This Court has repeatedly stated that a vital element of the Brignoni-Ponce standard is whether the agent had reason to believe that the pickup truck camper in question had come from the United States-Mexican border. The court also considers factors such as the lateness of the hour and previous experience of agents with illegal alien traffic."
