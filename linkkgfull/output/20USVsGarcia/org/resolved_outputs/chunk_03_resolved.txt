Pruszenski was driving the United States Border Patrol's patrol car. While traveling alongside the pickup truck camper, Baron leaned out of the window of the patrol car and observed three females in the front seat of the pickup truck camper and five or six men in the back seat of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper. When Baron shined his flashlight into the pickup truck camper, according to the United States Border Patrol, the male passengers attempted to conceal themselves by ducking and scrambling down below the window. The United States Border Patrol testified that the men's clothes and hair appeared unwashed, dirty and "very unruly and unkempt," a characteristic considered common to individuals who have recently spent time in the brush.

Their suspicion aroused, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, as agents of the United States Border Patrol, stopped the pickup truck camper for an immigration inspection on Interstate Highway 35. Upon questioning, the driver and several passengers admitted to the United States Border Patrol that they were Mexican citizens without immigration documents. After receiving this information, the United States Border Patrol then opened the rear window to the pickup truck camper and found fourteen additional males lying down on the floor, all of whom admitted they were illegal aliens. The United States Border Patrol arrested Maria De Jesus Garcia, the owner of the pickup truck camper, and Lourdes Rangel-Campos, the driver, and took the remaining passengers into custody.
