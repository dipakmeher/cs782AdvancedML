"It is well settled that probable cause to search an automobile exists when trustworthy facts and circumstances within the officer's personal knowledge would cause a reasonably prudent man to believe that the pickup truck camper contains contraband. We must also be mindful that 'probable cause is the sum total of layers of information and the synthesis of what the police have heard, what they know, and what they observed as trained officers. We weigh not individual layers but the \"laminated\" total.' (5th Circuit Court of Appeals) (en banc), (citations omitted).

Once several passengers of pickup truck camper admitted to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron that they were undocumented aliens, that fact, coupled with those observations suggesting that there were other individuals within the pickup truck camper, provided probable cause to search the pickup truck camper for other illegal aliens. Thus, no violation resulted from either the stop on Interstate Highway 35 or search of pickup truck camper, and her argument to that effect must fail.

THE ALLEN CHARGE

pickup truck camper launches a two-pronged attack against the modified Allen charge given to the jury in pickup truck camper's trial. First, she argues that use of any form of the Allen charge is coercive and thus violates the right to a fair trial. Second, she contends that the Allen charge, even if not inherently prejudicial, was unduly coercive in the context of this case."
