Before trial, defense counsel moved to suppress evidence obtained by the government as a result of the stop and search of pickup truck camper. Defense counsel also moved to extend the deadline for filing the suppression motion, which had already passed. Although the district court in pickup truck camper's case denied the extension motion, it allowed pickup truck camper at pickup truck camper's trial to present evidence pertinent to the suppression motion, and made oral findings of fact regarding the constitutionality of the stop on Interstate Highway 35 and search, concluding that they were proper. The government on appeal waives any objection to the timeliness of pickup truck camper's suppression motion, and we consider it on its merits.

To justify the suppression of evidence in this case, we must consider first, whether there was a sufficient basis to stop pickup truck camper, and second, whether there was probable cause to permit the subsequent search of the pickup truck camper.
