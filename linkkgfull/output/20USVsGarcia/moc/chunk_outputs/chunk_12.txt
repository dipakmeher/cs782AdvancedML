Maria De Jesus Garcia also argues that the Allen charge was particularly coercive as used in this case because the charge was given to jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial on a Friday afternoon, after jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial had twice indicated that it was deadlocked and that the dissenting jurors' decisions were irreversible. Maria De Jesus Garcia contends the charge coerced the dissenting jurors, who Maria De Jesus Garcia presumes desired an acquittal, into voting to convict. The decision on whether the Allen charge should be given, and when it should be given, "is within the sound discretion of United States District Court." 5th Circuit Court of Appeals finds no abuse of discretion here.
