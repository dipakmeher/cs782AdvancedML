We  have little difficulty in accepting as a fact that the United States Border Patrol agents honestly believed the pickup truck camper to be carrying illegal aliens. Indeed the  conviction of the appellant, Maria De Jesus Garcia, on four counts of violating is evidence of the absolute correctness of their belief.  If the  reasonableness of a stop depended on the United States Border Patrol agents' subjective beliefs our inquiry would end here.  The Brignoni-Ponce standard,  however, requires us to test this stop in a different manner.
