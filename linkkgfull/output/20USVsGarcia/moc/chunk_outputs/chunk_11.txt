At the outset, we note that "it is well settled in this circuit that the Allen charge is permissible, within the limitations of our prior decisions." (footnote omitted). Maria De Jesus Garcia does not attack the language of the Allen charge used below, which "was well within these limitations."

In United States v. Garcia, aff'd en banc, 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a general attack on the Allen charge as being inherently coercive in any form. Id., 468 F.2d at 661, 480 F.2d at 518. Accord, United States v. Garcia. "5th Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly upheld the use of the modified Allen charge." Unless sitting en banc, 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is bound by the prior decisions of 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
