Maria De Jesus Garcia asserts that the passengers' allegedly evasive actions were merely attempts to avoid eye contact with the beam from Baron's flashlight shined by Alfred Baron into Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper. If Maria De Jesus Garcia's characterization of the facts is correct, then we must disregard these actions, because "the avoidance of eye contact can have no weight whatsoever" in the suspicion calculus. Moreover, "it is not unusual for one . . . to be startled by lights being flashed suddenly into the interior of his pickup truck camper." United States Border Patrol testified, however, that the passengers in the back seat of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper did much more than merely avoid eye contact with Baron's flashlight. United States Border Patrol testified that when the light was shone into Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, "behind Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper's front seat, we could observe five or six people moving and slouching low as to get out of the light trying to hide." United States Border Patrol, who was closer to Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper carrying the aliens, testified:

As soon as I turned on Baron's flashlight, there was a male . . . looking out the window of the patrol car in this pickup truck camper. As soon as I turned on Baron's flashlight, he ducked, and the rest of the men were making the biggest effort they could to conceal themselves where they could not be seen.
