In the absence of an inference that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper to be stopped came from the United States-Mexican border, the remaining factors known to the United States Border Patrol must be carefully examined to determine whether "other articulable facts 'reasonably warrant suspicion'". In the present case, the remaining factors relied upon by the majority included: other illegal aliens had been seized near the location of the instant stop where the United States Border Patrol encountered Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper; the interstate highway on which Maria De Jesus Garcia was traveling was "a common smuggling route"; the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper were unwashed and unkempt; the type of pickup truck camper driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, a pickup truck camper, is often used to transport illegal aliens; the windows of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper appeared to be fogged, suggesting that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper carried living cargo; the lateness of the hour at the time of the stop on Interstate Highway 35; the scrambling of the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper when Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron shined their flashlight at them; the seemingly heavy load in Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper; the speed of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper; and the specialized training of United States Border Patrol involved in the stop on Interstate Highway 35. Because I believe that the consideration of several of these factors departs from the precedents of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, despite the majority's distinguishment of them as not controlling, and that the remaining factors cannot, standing alone, support the stop of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, I cannot join the opinion of the panel majority, excellently reasoned as it is.
