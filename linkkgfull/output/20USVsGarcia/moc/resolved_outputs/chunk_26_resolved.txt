That Interstate Highway 35 on which Maria De Jesus Garcia was stopped and that the type of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper she was driving are commonly used for the smuggling of aliens must be insufficient, standing alone, to support reasonable suspicion for a stop, unless, of course, we are willing to permit all vehicles commonly used for smuggling (of which there are an increasing number) to be stopped at any distance over 115 miles from the United States-Mexican border on designated highways -- subject only to the discretion and availability of United States Border Patrol. The controlling factor in this case, if the investigatory stop on Interstate Highway 35 was lawful, must be the unkempt appearance of Maria De Jesus Garcia, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and others, which is alleged to be consistent with the appearance of illegal aliens. In short, we must rely on the ability of United States Border Patrol to discern whether the appearance of the Hispanic occupants of a given Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper are more or less like that of the typical illegal alien, rather than that of any other poor and disheveled American of Hispanic descent. I cannot accord controlling weight to this factor.
