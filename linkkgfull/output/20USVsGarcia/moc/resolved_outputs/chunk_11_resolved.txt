At the outset, we note that "it is well settled in this circuit that the Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is permissible, within the limitations of our prior decisions." (footnote omitted). Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial does not attack the language of the Allen charge used in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial, which "was well within these limitations."

In United States v. Garcia, a case decided by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, aff'd en banc, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a general attack on the Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals as being inherently coercive in any form. Id., 468 F.2d at 661, 480 F.2d at 518. Accord, United States v. Garcia, a case decided by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. "The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly upheld the use of the modified Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals." Unless sitting en banc, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is bound by the prior decisions of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
