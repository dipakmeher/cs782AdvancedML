I do not mean to suggest that this combination of factors (the reputation of Interstate Highway 35 as a common smuggling route, the type of pickup truck driven by Maria De Jesus Garcia, and the appearance of Maria De Jesus Garcia, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and others) could never constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron if at a distance closer to the United States-Mexican border than that involved here. Nonetheless, when a vehicle is traveling 115 miles from the United States-Mexican border and no permissible inference can be made that it came from the United States-Mexican border, I conclude that the factors presented to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that are worthy of consideration in light of the precedents of this circuit, as I view them, cannot rise to the level of reasonable suspicion without also subjecting innocent persons who lawfully reside in the United States to intrusive stops by Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron based primarily on their appearance as being of Hispanic descent. Conclusion

For these reasons, and with great respect for the contrary views of my brethren, I, GARWOOD, dissent.
