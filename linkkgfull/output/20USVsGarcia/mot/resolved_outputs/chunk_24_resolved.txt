I am unwilling to believe that, based upon a fleeting moment of observation, border patrol agents Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron are able to accurately assess that the occupants of pickup truck camper are "trying to hide" rather than reacting to a bright light. Furthermore, I cannot distinguish the "ducking and scrambling" in this case from the "slouching and hunkering down" that we previously refused to consider as a factor supporting the reasonableness of a stop. See Pena-Cantu case, supra, 659 F.2d at 1229-30. Where, as here, a great deal of physical movement occurs in the pickup truck camper at night immediately after a bright flashlight is directed at the occupants, I cannot in a "chary" review of the facts (as required where the stop is made miles and miles from the United States-Mexican border, see decisions cited, supra) conclude that pickup truck camper, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and others' reaction to the beam of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron's flashlight should be weighed as a significant factor supporting a reasonable suspicion that pickup truck camper was transporting aliens.
