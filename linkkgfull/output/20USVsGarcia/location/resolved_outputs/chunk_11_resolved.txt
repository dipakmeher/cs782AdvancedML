At the outset, we note that "it is well settled in this circuit that the Allen charge is permissible, within the limitations of our prior decisions." (footnote omitted). Maria De Jesus Garcia does not attack the language of the Allen charge used below, which "was well within these limitations."

In United States v. Garcia, aff'd en banc, 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a general attack on the Allen charge as being inherently coercive in any form. Id., 468 F.2d at 661, 480 F.2d at 518. Accord, United States v. Garcia. "5th Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly upheld the use of the modified Allen charge." Unless sitting en banc, 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is bound by the prior decisions of 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Maria De Jesus Garcia also argues that the Allen charge was particularly coercive as used in this case because the charge was given to jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial on a Friday afternoon, after jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial had twice indicated that it was deadlocked and that the dissenting jurors' decisions were irreversible. Maria De Jesus Garcia contends the charge coerced the dissenting jurors, who Maria De Jesus Garcia presumes desired an acquittal, into voting to convict. The decision on whether the Allen charge should be given, and when it should be given, "is within the sound discretion of district court in Maria De Jesus Garcia's case." 5th Circuit Court of Appeals finds no abuse of discretion here.
