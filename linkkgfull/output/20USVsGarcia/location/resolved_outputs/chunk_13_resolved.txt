Maria De Jesus Garcia's final contention is that the district court in Maria De Jesus Garcia's case erred in refusing to allow her to conduct post-verdict "discovery" through juror depositions and interrogatories in order to determine whether the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial were coerced by the Allen charge.

"Historically, interrogations of jurors have not been favored by federal courts except where there is some showing of illegal or prejudicial intrusion into the jury process." , (emphasis in original). Accord, . The only intrusion alleged here was the giving of the Allen charge to the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial, which the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has held was not error. That is not the type of "illegal or prejudicial intrusion into the jury process" that might justify post-verdict interviews of jurors.

In United States v. Maria De Jesus Garcia, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district court in Maria De Jesus Garcia's case's refusal to conduct a post-verdict hearing on whether the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial was coerced by a properly given Allen charge, noting that "the only questions that would have been asked would have concerned the juror's internal mental processes in reaching the verdict." Here too, defense counsel's only purpose for seeking to interview jurors was to probe the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial's "process of deliberation and find out how and why the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial reached its verdict. That is the one form of attack on a verdict that has always been forbidden in Anglo-American criminal law." The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Maria De Jesus Garcia's motion to interview jurors.
