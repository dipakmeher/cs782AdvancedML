Maria De Jesus Garcia launches a two-pronged attack against the modified Allen charge given to the jury in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial. First, she argues that use of any form of the Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is coercive and thus violates the right to a fair trial. Second, she contends that the Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, even if not inherently prejudicial, was unduly coercive in the context of this case."

At the outset, we note that "it is well settled in this circuit that the Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is permissible, within the limitations of our prior decisions." (footnote omitted). Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial does not attack the language of the Allen charge used in Maria De Jesus Garcia's trial, which "was well within these limitations."
