Pruszenski was driving the United States Border Patrol's patrol car. While traveling alongside Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, Baron leaned out of the window of the patrol car and observed three females in the front seat of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper and five or six men in the back seat of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper. When Baron shined Baron's flashlight into Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, according to the United States Border Patrol, the male passengers attempted to conceal themselves by ducking and scrambling down below the window of the patrol car. The United States Border Patrol testified that the men's clothes and hair appeared unwashed, dirty and "very unruly and unkempt," a characteristic considered common to individuals who have recently spent time in the brush.
