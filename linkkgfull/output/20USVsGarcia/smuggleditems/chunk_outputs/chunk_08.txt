Although we find that United States Border Patrol did not have sufficient information to reasonably suspect that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper came from the United States-Mexican border, the Brignoni-Ponce standard may still be satisfied "if other articulable facts 'reasonably warrant suspicion.'" We are required, however, to examine these facts charily. After a careful review of the record, we note that many of the factors deemed relevant in Brignoni-Ponce and its progeny are present in this case.
