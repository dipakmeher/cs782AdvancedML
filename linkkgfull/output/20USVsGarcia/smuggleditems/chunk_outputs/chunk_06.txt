Both parties agree that because the investigatory stop on Interstate Highway 35 in this case was made by roving United States Border Patrol agents, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, the legality of the stop on Interstate Highway 35 must be determined according to the principles articulated in Brignoni-Ponce standard. In that decision, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals held that "except at the United States-Mexican border and its functional equivalents, officers on roving patrol may stop vehicles only if they are aware of specific articulable facts, together with reasonable inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicles contain aliens who may be illegally in the United States." The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals stated that the following factors may be considered in determining whether a stop is justified: characteristics of the area covered by the Cotulla, Texas Border Patrol Station in which Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper is encountered, including proximity to the United States-Mexican border, usual traffic patterns on Interstate Highway 35, and history of illegal alien traffic; type and appearance of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, including whether it appears heavily loaded; behavior of the driver; and number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers. These factors are not exclusive. Rather, "the totality of the circumstances -- the whole picture -- must be taken into account." Accord, Orona-Sanchez case, Lamas case, Pacheco case, Pena-Cantu case. "Based upon that whole picture Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, the detaining United States Border Patrol officers, must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting . . . the particular pickup truck camper they stopped was engaged in criminal activity." "In all situations, the United States Border Patrol officer is entitled to assess the facts in light of his experience in detecting illegal entry and smuggling in Texas."
