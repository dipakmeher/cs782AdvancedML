That some of the passengers "were sitting low" was held insufficient to justify the investigatory stop on Interstate Highway 35 in Orona-Sanchez case. Such a static condition is one common to Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper passengers. The same ruling was made in Orona-Sanchez case, 648 F.2d at 1041-42, respecting the circumstance that, between the time Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper initially drove by the then stationary agents and the time the agents later caught up with and passed it, two of the passengers "had 'sort of slouched down'" so only the tops of their heads were visible to the passing agents. However, it was after dark and that character of change over several minutes to a more recumbent position by nighttime passengers is not unusual. Moreover, in Orona-Sanchez case we gave "substantial weight to the fact that these agents were new to the area . . . ." Id. at 1042. In Lamas case, we held the fact that "passengers in the back seat appeared to slouch down" as Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper passed the agents, while "certainly a suspicious reaction," was nevertheless not "on its own sufficient" to justify the investigatory stop on Interstate Highway 35. In Pacheco case we made the same holding respecting similar testimony that the passengers "'hunkered down' in the seat." While the passenger conduct in Lamas case and Pacheco case is more suspicious than that in Pena-Cantu case and Orona-Sanchez case, it is clearly less suspicious than the more extensive, active, abrupt, and obviously evasive conduct described by the agents here. Ducking and scrambling around is certainly less typical of innocent passengers than slouching or hunkering down. Cf. e.g., (distinguishing Orona-Sanchez case and Pacheco case). Because "each case must turn on the totality of the particular circumstances" in that case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, while we consider the clearly evasive actions of the passengers in Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper as a significant factor in justifying the investigatory stop on Interstate Highway 35, we need not determine whether it alone would suffice, other factors also being present here.
