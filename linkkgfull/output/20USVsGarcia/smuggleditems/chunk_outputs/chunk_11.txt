"It is well settled that probable cause to search an automobile exists when trustworthy facts and circumstances within the officer's personal knowledge would cause a reasonably prudent man to believe that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper contains contraband. We must also be mindful that 'probable cause is the sum total of layers of information and the synthesis of what the police have heard, what they know, and what they observed as trained officers. We weigh not individual layers but the \"laminated\" total.' (the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals) (en banc), (citations omitted).

Once several passengers of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper admitted to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron that they were undocumented aliens, that fact, coupled with those observations suggesting that there were other individuals within Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, provided probable cause to search Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper for other illegal aliens. Thus, no violation resulted from either the investigatory stop on Interstate Highway 35 or the search of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, and her argument to that effect must fail.
