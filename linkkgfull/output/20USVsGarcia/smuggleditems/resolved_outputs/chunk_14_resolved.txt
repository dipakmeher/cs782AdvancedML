Maria De Jesus Garcia also argues that the modified Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals was particularly coercive as used in United States v. Garcia because the charge was given to the jury in United States v. Garcia on a Friday afternoon, after the jury in United States v. Garcia had twice indicated that it was deadlocked and that the dissenting jurors' decisions were irreversible. Maria De Jesus Garcia contends the charge coerced the dissenting jurors, who Maria De Jesus Garcia presumes desired an acquittal, into voting to convict. The decision on whether the modified Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals should be given, and when it should be given, "is within the sound discretion of the United States District Court." The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals finds no abuse of discretion here.
