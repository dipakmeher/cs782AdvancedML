On February 18, 1983, United States Border Patrol agents Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron were sitting in their marked United States Border Patrol's patrol car overlooking the northbound lanes of Interstate Highway 35 just south of Moore, Texas about 115 miles from the United States-Mexican border. At approximately 11:30 p.m., Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron spotted Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper traveling northbound unusually slowly, its headlights angled up. The United States Border Patrol agents entered traffic to further observe Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper. They saw that its bumper was low, its tires "were squashed down," the wheel wells were covering part of the tires, and it was loaded heavily in the rear. Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper was weaving, it appearing "that the driver, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, was having a hard time controlling Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper due to the weight in the back, making the front end light." When the United States Border Patrol agents pulled their patrol car alongside Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper and shined Baron's flashlight out of the window of the patrol car to illuminate Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, they noticed that the windows of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper were "completely fogged over." The United States Border Patrol agents testified that the night was cold, and that the fogged windows indicated to them that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper contained undocumented aliens, perhaps twenty-two undocumented aliens.
