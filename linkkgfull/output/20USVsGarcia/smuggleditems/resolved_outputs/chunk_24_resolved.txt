We have also refused to accord weight to the observations of United States Border Patrol that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper's occupants "hunkered down" when the agents passed or were sitting low so as to avoid detection, see Orona-Sanchez case, or that the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper were startled by the beam of Baron's flashlight. The majority reasons that these decisions are inapposite since the occupants of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper "did much more than merely avoid eye contact with Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron's flashlight." (Maj. op. at 1224 n. 1). United States Border Patrol testified that the occupants were "moving and slouching low as to get out of the light trying to hide." United States Border Patrol testified that, after he shined his flashlight into Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, "they were scrambling around trying to get lower than the windows were so that . . . I couldn't see them with a flashlight. They were scrambling around in Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper." The majority considered this testimony relevant since "ducking and scrambling around is certainly less typical of innocent passengers than slouching or hunkering down." (Maj. op. at 1225).
