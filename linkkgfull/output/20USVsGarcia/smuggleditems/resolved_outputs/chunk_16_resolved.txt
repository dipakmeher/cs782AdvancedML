Maria De Jesus Garcia's final contention is that the United States District Court erred in refusing to allow her to conduct post-verdict "discovery" through juror depositions and interrogatories in order to determine whether the jury in United States v. Garcia were coerced by the modified Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

"Historically, interrogations of jurors have not been favored by federal courts except where there is some showing of illegal or prejudicial intrusion into the jury process." , (emphasis in original). Accord, . The only intrusion alleged here was the giving of the modified Allen charge to the jury in United States v. Garcia, which the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has held was not error. That is not the type of "illegal or prejudicial intrusion into the jury process" that might justify post-verdict interviews of jurors.
