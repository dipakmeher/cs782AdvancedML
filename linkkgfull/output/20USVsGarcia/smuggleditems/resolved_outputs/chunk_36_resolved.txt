"Your failure to agree upon a verdict will necessitate another trial of United States v. Garcia. There is nothing to indicate that it can be better tried or presented at some other time any more exhaustively than it has been by both sides of the case during this trial of United States v. Garcia. Also, you should consider that United States v. Garcia at some time must be decided, and that you were selected in the same manner and from the same source from which any future jury must be selected. There is no reason to suppose that United States v. Garcia will ever be submitted to a jury more intelligent, more impartial or more competent to decide it, or that more clear evidence will be produced on one side or another."
