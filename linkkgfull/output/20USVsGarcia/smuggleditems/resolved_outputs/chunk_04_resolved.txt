Their suspicion aroused, Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron, as agents of the United States Border Patrol, stopped Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper for an immigration inspection on Interstate Highway 35. Upon questioning, the driver and several passengers admitted to the United States Border Patrol that they were undocumented aliens without immigration documents. After receiving this information, the United States Border Patrol then opened the rear window to Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper and found fourteen additional males lying down on the floor, all of whom admitted they were undocumented aliens. The United States Border Patrol arrested Maria De Jesus Garcia, the owner of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper, and Lourdes Rangel-Campos, the driver, and took the remaining passengers into custody.
