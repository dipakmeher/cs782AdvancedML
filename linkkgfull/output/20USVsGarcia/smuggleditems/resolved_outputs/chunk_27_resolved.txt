Another factor relied upon by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is also, in my view, unworthy of meaningful weight. The United States District Court refers to the lateness of the hour as a relevant consideration adding to reasonable suspicion. We have held, however, that a "decision to travel such roads at less busy hours should not be the difference -- constitutionally speaking -- determinative of the right of the United States Border Patrol to stop vehicles."

Admittedly, however, other factors relied upon by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals perhaps do merit consideration, e.g., the previous experience of Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron with illegal alien traffic on Interstate Highway 35, the type of Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper driven by Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and the unkempt appearances of Maria De Jesus Garcia, Lourdes Rangel-Campos, and others. Carefully weighing these remaining factors, I conclude that United States Border Patrol had insufficient articulable facts to support a reasonable suspicion that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper driven by Lourdes Rangel-Campos was transporting undocumented aliens. Foremost among my concerns are (1) the distance between the United States-Mexican border and the point at which the investigatory stop on Interstate Highway 35 occurred, and (2) my hesitation to credit the ability of United States Border Patrol to distinguish an undocumented alien from a lawful resident, based on physical appearances, after a few quick glimpses while traveling at considerable speeds on Interstate Highway 35.
