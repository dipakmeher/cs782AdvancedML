To its credit, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has tried to apply the precedents of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in a principled way to the present facts of United States v. Garcia. I am afraid, however, that this attempt has only succeeded in differentiating otherwise irreconcilable precedent of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals through an unsteady calculus of what factors may permissibly be considered when determining whether United States Border Patrol agents have an objectively "reasonable suspicion" to make a stop. With great respect for the views of my brethren in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, I must dissent.

II.

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals correctly notes that this stop by a roving United States Border Patrol requires the application of the Brignoni-Ponce standard. Accordingly, we must assess the lawfulness of the stop in light of the totality of the circumstances known to Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron at the time of the stop. A vital element of this test is whether the agent who made the stop had "reason to believe that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper in question had come from the United States-Mexican border." Maria De Jesus Garcia was stopped on Interstate Highway 35 in Texas 115 miles north of the United States-Mexican border. As the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals candidly admits, nothing in United States v. Garcia suggests that Stanley Pruszenski and Alfred Baron had any reason to believe that Maria De Jesus Garcia's pickup truck camper had come from the United States-Mexican border.
