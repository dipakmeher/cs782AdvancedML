Maria De Jesus Garcia launches a two-pronged attack against the modified Allen charge given to the jury in United States v. Garcia. First, she argues that use of any form of the modified Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is coercive and thus violates the right to a fair trial. Second, she contends that the modified Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, even if not inherently prejudicial, was unduly coercive in the context of United States v. Garcia.

At the outset, we note that "it is well settled in this circuit that the modified Allen charge used in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is permissible, within the limitations of our prior decisions." (footnote omitted). United States v. Garcia does not attack the language of the modified Allen charge used in United States v. Garcia, which "was well within these limitations."
