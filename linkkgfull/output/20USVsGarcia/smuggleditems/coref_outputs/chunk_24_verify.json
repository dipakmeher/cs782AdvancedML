    "undocumented aliens": "individuals being smuggled in relation to Maria De Jesus Garcia's case, attempting to hide from United States Border Patrol agents by ducking and scrambling around, potentially indicated by fogged windows of the pickup truck camper on a cold night, with unwashed and dirty clothes and hair, and making sudden attempts to evade detection. The occupants were moving and slouching low as to get out of the light trying to hide, and after being shined with a flashlight, they were scrambling around trying to get lower than the windows so that they couldn't be seen."
