As a courtesy, Agent Luis Pena asked Zeba Williams for consent to search the tractor-trailer's sleeper area, and Zeba Williams obliged. From where he was standing on the tractor-trailer's exterior steps, Agent Luis Pena peeked into the tractor-trailer's rear sleeper area and saw a fold-up bed cracked open at an odd angle. He asked Raymond McMillon to pull the bed down; Raymond McMillon got up from his seat and attempted to do so, but stated that the bed was stuck. Agent Luis Pena then entered the tractor-trailer and attempted to lower the bed himself, at which time he saw a person's face hidden between the bed and the tractor-trailer's wall. At approximately 4:16:09 a.m., Agent Luis Pena exited the tractor-trailer and informed Agent Manuel Hernandez that "it was going to be positive for aliens sic smuggling."

The agents, Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez, placed Zeba Williams and Raymond McMillon under arrest. During a subsequent search, agents discovered a total of ten undocumented aliens hidden in the tractor-trailer's closets and beds.
