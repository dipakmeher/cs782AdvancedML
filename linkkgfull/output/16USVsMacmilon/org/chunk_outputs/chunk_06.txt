On July 8, 2014, Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams were charged by indictment with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens within the United States for commercial advantage or private financial gain, in violation of and; and two substantive counts of transporting aliens within the United States for commercial advantage or private financial gain, in violation of and. Counts Two and Three specifically alleged that Raymond McMillon had transported aliens Ramon De La Cruz ("Ramon De La Cruz") and Jorge Miguel Hernandez-Gomez ("Jorge Miguel Hernandez-Gomez")—both of whom were discovered hidden in the tractor-trailer's sleeper area—within the United States.

Prior to trial, Raymond McMillon moved to suppress all evidence seized from the checkpoint stop, challenging both the duration of the stop and the ensuing search of the tractor-trailer. After a two-day suppression hearing, the district court denied the motion, concluding that neither the duration of the stop nor the search of the tractor-trailer violated Raymond McMillon's rights.

Shortly thereafter, Raymond McMillon filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, arguing that 104 non-excludable days had elapsed since the date of his indictment. The district court also denied that motion, reasoning that less than seventy non-excludable days had elapsed since Raymond McMillon's indictment.
