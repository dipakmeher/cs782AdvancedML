In light of these principles, it is clear that Luis Pena did not extend the checkpoint stop beyond its permissible duration. The United States District Court's factual findings, which are amply supported by the suppression testimony and thus not clearly erroneous, indicate that the countable duration of the stop—i.e., the time just before Luis Pena made contact with Zeba Williams and Raymond McMillon at approximately 4:14:35 a.m. until Zeba Williams consented to a search at approximately 4:15:07 a.m.—lasted about thirty or forty seconds. See ("We note initially that our inquiry considers only Luis Pena's questioning of Raymond McMillon up to the point at which Raymond McMillon consented to a search of his tractor-trailer. After Raymond McMillon consented to a search, Luis Pena needed no justification to prolong the encounter."). During this time, citizenship and travel plans questions were asked and answered, and Luis Pena requested and received consent to a search. A checkpoint stop lasting approximately thirty to forty seconds to allow United States Border Patrol agents to ask citizenship and travel questions and to request consent for a search is of a sufficiently limited duration under our precedent. See, e.g., (approving a checkpoint stop lasting "no more than a couple of minutes" during which United States Border Patrol agents questioned occupants as to citizenship and travel plans and requested consent for a search); see also (per curiam) (holding that a stop "lasting no longer than one to one and one half minutes" was "within the time approved in Machuca-Barrera" and thus "did not exceed the permissible duration of an immigration stop"); (citing, inter alia, Machuca-Barrera and holding constitutional a checkpoint stop that lasted "clearly less than half a minute").
