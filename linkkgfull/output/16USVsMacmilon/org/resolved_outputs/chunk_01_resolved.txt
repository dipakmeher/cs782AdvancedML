Raymond McMillon is a defendant. Raymond McMillon is an Appellant.

PER CURIAM:

United States Border Patrol agents at Freer, Texas discovered ten undocumented aliens hidden in a tractor-trailer in which Raymond McMillon ("Raymond McMillon") was a passenger. Raymond McMillon was subsequently convicted of several alien transportation offenses and sentenced to a total of 41 months' imprisonment. He now appeals, challenging the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from the checkpoint stop, the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on Speedy Trial Act grounds, the sufficiency of the evidence on each of his convictions, and the denial of his request for a mitigated role adjustment at sentencing. Finding no error in the United States District Court's proceedings, we AFFIRM.

I.

We view the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing and discussed herein in the light most favorable to the United States Government as the prevailing party in the United States District Court. See. Similarly, all relevant evidence produced at trial and discussed herein is taken in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. See, e.g.,.
