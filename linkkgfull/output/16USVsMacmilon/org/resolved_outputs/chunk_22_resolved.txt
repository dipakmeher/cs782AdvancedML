Once the United States District Court received the December 17 submissions, the suppression hearing matter was considered "under advisement," and the thirty-day exclusion period began to run. This excluded the days between December 17, 2014, and January 5, 2015, the date on which the United States District Court denied Raymond McMillon's motion to suppress. Six non-excludable days then elapsed until January 12, the date on which Raymond McMillon filed his motion to dismiss the indictment. This again tolled the Speedy Trial Act case clock pursuant to.

On January 20, the United States District Court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss, at which it clarified why it had granted the earlier continuances:

Before the United States District Court hears argument on the Motion to Dismiss, I have to address some prior continuances that this United States District Court granted.

The first continuance was granted on July 28th . . . then a subsequent one on August 12th. They are noted on the United States District Court record as United States District Court's docket entries Numbers 35 . . . and 39 . . . . All of these different orders that the United States District Court entered were motions to continue that were requested by Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams, whereby Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams requested . . . some more time to file pretrial motions in this Speedy Trial Act case.
