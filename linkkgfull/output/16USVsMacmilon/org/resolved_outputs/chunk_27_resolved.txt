However, even generously assuming arguendo that we should exclude the "off the record" period identified by Raymond McMillon, there would still be no speedy trial violation. Assuming that the 30-day advisement period began upon the United States District Court's October 22 receipt of the first set of canine records, then it would have ended on November 20. Forty-five non-excludable days then elapsed between November 20 and January 5, the date on which the United States District Court ruled on Raymond McMillon's motion to suppress. Added to the seventeen non-excludable days and six non-excludable days discussed supra, this means that only sixty-eight non-excludable days would have elapsed. Because sixty-eight non-excludable days between indictment and trial complies with the Speedy Trial Act, see, Raymond McMillon's argument still fails. Accordingly, we affirm the United States District Court's denial of Raymond McMillon's motion to dismiss.
