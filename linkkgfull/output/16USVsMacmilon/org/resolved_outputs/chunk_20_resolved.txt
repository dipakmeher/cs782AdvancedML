Applying these statutory exceptions and our case law, we hold that the United States District Court correctly concluded that less than seventy non-excludable days elapsed between Raymond McMillon's indictment and trial. Raymond McMillon's speedy trial clock began on July 8, 2014, the date of his indictment. Seventeen non-excludable days then elapsed until Raymond McMillon filed his first motion to continue on July 25, which tolled the Speedy Trial Act clock pursuant to. On July 28, the United States District Court granted Raymond McMillon's motion and extended the time for pretrial motions until August 11—the Speedy Trial Act clock remained tolled during this continuance period pursuant to. On August 11, Raymond McMillon filed a second motion to continue, which again tolled the clock pursuant to. On August 12, the United States District Court granted Raymond McMillon's second motion and extended the time for pretrial motions until August 18—the Speedy Trial Act clock remained tolled during this continuance period pursuant to.
