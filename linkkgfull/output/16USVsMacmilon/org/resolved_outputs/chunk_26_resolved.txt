Second,  Raymond McMillon argues that delay attributable to certain matters that  occurred "off the record"— i.e. ,  events that indisputably occurred but that were not formally noted  on the United States District Court's docket—cannot be excluded. While not  completely clear, he appears to argue that Raymond McMillon's  30-day advisement period should have started on October 22, 2014—the  date on which the United States District Court received the first set of canine records for in  camera inspection pursuant to its October    15 docket order—rather than December 17—the date on which the  United States District Court received the second set of canine submissions for in  camera inspection without memorializing its receipt or request with a  formal docket entry.

Raymond McMillon's  argument is unconvincing and without merit. Raymond McMillon directs our  attention to no authority suggesting that we must exclude matters  that occurred "off the record" for Speedy Trial Act purposes.  Indeed, under the circumstances here, it would make little sense for  such events—which indisputably occurred at Raymond McMillon's request and  solely for his benefit—to be ignored merely because the United States District Court failed to make a formal notation on the United States District Court's docket.
