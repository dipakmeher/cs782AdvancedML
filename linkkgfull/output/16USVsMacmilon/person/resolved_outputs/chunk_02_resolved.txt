Raymond McMillon's run-in with the law arises from his travels through Texas with his co-defendant, Zeba Williams ("Zeba Williams"). Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams first traveled from Houston to San Antonio in a rental car "to do a construction job." Once in San Antonio, Zeba Williams asked Raymond McMillon to accompany him in a tractor-trailer to Laredo to pick up a piece of commercial equipment. Specifically, Raymond McMillon testified that Zeba Williams asked him to ride along and "to maybe help . . . drive back." Raymond McMillon did not drive the tractor-trailer at any point on the way to Laredo but "guessed" that he would have driven on the way back.
