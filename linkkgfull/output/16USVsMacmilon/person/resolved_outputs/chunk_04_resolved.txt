Agent Luis Pena began to question Zeba Williams and Raymond McMillon as Agent Manuel Hernandez was "working his dog." Agent Luis Pena asked Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams if they were United States citizens, and each confirmed that they were. Agent Luis Pena then questioned Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams about their travel plans. At approximately 4:15:07 a.m., as Zeba Williams responded to the travel question, Agent Manuel Hernandez told Agent Luis Pena to "check the back." Agent Luis Pena understood this to mean that Aroxa had alerted to the presence of contraband in the tractor.

As a courtesy, Agent Luis Pena asked Zeba Williams for consent to search the tractor's sleeper area, and Zeba Williams obliged. From where he was standing on the tractor's exterior steps, Agent Luis Pena peeked into the tractor's rear sleeper area and saw a fold-up bed cracked open at an odd angle. He asked Raymond McMillon to pull the bed down; Raymond McMillon got up from his seat and attempted to do so, but stated that the bed was stuck. Agent Luis Pena then entered the tractor and attempted to lower the bed himself, at which time he saw a person's face hidden between the bed and the tractor's wall. At approximately 4:16:09 a.m., Agent Luis Pena exited the tractor and informed Agent Manuel Hernandez that "it was going to be positive for aliens sic smuggling."
