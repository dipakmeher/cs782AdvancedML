* Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.

1 Raymond McMillon emphasizes that "Luis Pena required Zeba Williams to open the door from the inception and he secured a position on the steps next to Zeba Williams . . . as a show of authority that assured Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams could not leave until Luis Pena closed the door." Raymond McMillon's attack on the voluntariness of Zeba Williams' consent is belied by Zeba Williams' own suppression testimony that Luis Pena asked —not ordered—him to open the door and that he knew he could refuse to do so if he wished.
