Raymond McMillon is a defendant. Raymond McMillon is an Appellant.

PER CURIAM:

Border Patrol agents at an immigration checkpoint discovered ten undocumented aliens hidden in a tractor-trailer in which Raymond McMillon ("Raymond McMillon") was a passenger. Raymond McMillon was subsequently convicted of several alien transportation offenses and sentenced to a total of 41 months' imprisonment. He now appeals, challenging the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from the checkpoint stop, the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, the sufficiency of the evidence on each of his convictions, and the denial of his request for a mitigated role adjustment at sentencing. Finding no error in the district court's proceedings, we AFFIRM.
