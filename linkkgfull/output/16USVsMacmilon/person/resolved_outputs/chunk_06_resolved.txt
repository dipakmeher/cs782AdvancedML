Shortly thereafter, Raymond McMillon filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, arguing that 104 non-excludable days had elapsed since the date of his indictment. The district court also denied that motion, reasoning that less than seventy non-excludable days had elapsed since Raymond McMillon's indictment.

On January 20, 2015, a one-day jury trial commenced, at which the Government proffered testimony from, inter alia, Luis Pena, Manuel Hernandez, Ramon De La Cruz, and Jorge Miguel Hernandez-Gomez. At the close of the Government's case-in-chief and at the close of evidence, Raymond McMillon moved for a Rule 29 judgment of acquittal on each offense alleged in the indictment. The court denied the motion on both occasions. After approximately ninety minutes of deliberations, the jury convicted Raymond McMillon of all three offenses and entered special findings that Raymond McMillon had committed each offense "for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain." As to the two substantive transportation counts, the jury also entered special findings that Raymond McMillon had acted as a principal rather than as an aider-and-abettor.
