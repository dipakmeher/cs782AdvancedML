Finally,  Raymond McMillon points to inconsistencies in the Bluetooth evidence  identifying him at trial. As Raymond McMillon identifies, there was indeed  arguably conflicting evidence about the Bluetooth at trial—Ramon De La Cruz and Jorge Miguel Hernandez-Gomez both testified that, at the parking lot, a  person wearing a Bluetooth instructed them to hide in the tractor,  and identified Raymond McMillon as that person; yet, Luis Pena and Eric Camacho both testified that the Bluetooth was seized from Zeba Williams,  not Raymond McMillon, after the checkpoint stop. However, Raymond McMillon pressed  these inconsistencies (albeit, to no avail) to the jury in  cross-examinations and in closing argument. And, the aliens'  testimony is not factually impossible; rather, it is entirely  possible that Raymond McMillon was wearing the Bluetooth when the    aliens were picked up and that Zeba Williams was wearing it some period  of time later during the checkpoint stop. The jury was free to  choose this reasonable construction of the evidence and to gauge the  credibility of the testifying witnesses in doing so.   It is not    our role to second-guess the jury's credibility determinations on  appeal. See,  e.g., ("Jurors are free to choose among reasonable constructions of  the evidence, and retain the sole authority . . . to evaluate the  credibility of the witnesses. In other words, for the latter, it is  not our court's role . . . to second-guess the determinations of the  jury as to the credibility of the evidence." (internal  alterations and citations omitted)). Accordingly, we affirm  Raymond McMillon's conspiracy conviction.
