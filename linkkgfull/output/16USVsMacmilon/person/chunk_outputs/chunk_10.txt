In  light of these principles, it is clear that Agent Pena did not  extend the checkpoint stop beyond its permissible duration. The  district court's factual findings, which are amply supported by the  suppression testimony and thus not clearly erroneous, indicate that  the countable duration of the stop— i.e. ,  the time just before Agent Pena made contact with Williams and  McMillon at approximately 4:14:35 a.m. until Williams consented to a  search at approximately 4:15:07 a.m.—lasted about thirty or forty  seconds. See ("We note initially that our inquiry considers only Agent's  questioning of Defendant up to the point at which Defendant  consented to a search of his car. After Defendant  consented    to a search, Agent needed no justification to prolong the  encounter."). During this time, citizenship and travel plans  questions were asked and answered, and Agent Pena requested and  received consent to a search. A checkpoint stop lasting  approximately thirty to forty seconds to allow border patrol agents  to ask citizenship and travel questions and to request consent for a  search is of a sufficiently limited duration under our precedent. See,  e.g., (approving a checkpoint stop lasting "no more than a couple of  minutes" during which Border Patrol agents questioned occupants  as to citizenship and travel plans and requested consent for a  search); see  also (per curiam) (holding that a stop "lasting no longer than one  to one and one half minutes" was "within the time approved  in Machuca-Barrera "  and thus "did not exceed the permissible duration of an  immigration stop"); (citing, inter  alia, Machuca-Barrera and holding constitutional a checkpoint stop that lasted "clearly  less than half a minute").
