McMillon's  third argument that Agent Pena's actions rendered Williams' consent  involuntary similarly fails.   Consent to a search must be knowing and voluntary "under the  totality of the circumstances." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have articulated  six primary factors to be considered in determining the  voluntariness of consent: "(1) the voluntariness of the  defendant's custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police  procedure; (3) the extent and level of the defendant's cooperation  with the police; (4) the defendant's awareness of his right to  refuse consent; (5) the defendant's education and intelligence; and  (6) the defendant's belief that no incriminating evidence will be  found." .  No single factor is dispositive. See .

Applying  the Tedford factors, the district court found, inter  alia ,  that Williams was stopped at the time he consented but was not  physically restrained or coerced; Williams was fully cooperative with Agent Pena during the encounter;  and Williams "appeared quite articulate on the stand,"  which "strongly indicated that he possessed sufficient  intelligence to consent voluntarily." Viewing these findings  with due regard to the district court's    opportunity to judge Williams' credibility at the suppression  hearing, we conclude that the district court's finding that Williams  voluntarily consented to the search was not clearly erroneous.
