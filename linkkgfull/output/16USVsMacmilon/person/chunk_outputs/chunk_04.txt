Agent  Pena began to question Williams and McMillon as Agent Hernandez was  "working his dog." Agent Pena asked the pair if they were  United States citizens, and each confirmed that they were. Agent  Pena then questioned the pair about their travel plans. At  approximately 4:15:07 a.m., as Williams responded to the travel  question, Agent Hernandez told Agent Pena to "check the back."  Agent Pena understood this to mean    that Aroxa had alerted to the presence of contraband in the tractor.

As  a courtesy, Agent Pena asked Williams for consent to search the  tractor's sleeper area, and Williams obliged. From where he was  standing on the tractor's exterior steps, Agent Pena peeked into the  tractor's rear sleeper area and saw a fold-up bed cracked open at an  odd angle. He asked McMillon to pull the bed down;    McMillon got up from his seat and attempted to do so, but stated  that the bed was stuck. Agent Pena then entered the tractor and  attempted to lower the bed himself, at which time he saw a person's  face hidden between the bed and the tractor's wall. At approximately  4:16:09 a.m., Agent Pena exited the tractor and informed Agent  Hernandez that "it was going to be positive for aliens sic  smuggling."
