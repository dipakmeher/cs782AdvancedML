Shortly  thereafter, McMillon filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on  speedy trial grounds, arguing that 104 non-excludable days had  elapsed since the date of his indictment. The district court also  denied that motion, reasoning that less than seventy non-excludable  days had elapsed since McMillon's indictment.

On  January 20, 2015, a one-day jury trial commenced, at which the  Government proffered testimony from, inter  alia ,  Agent Pena, Agent    Hernandez, De La Cruz, and Hernandez-Gomez. At the close of the  Government's case-in-chief and at the close of evidence, McMillon  moved for a Rule 29 judgment of acquittal on each offense alleged in  the indictment. The court denied the motion on both occasions. After  approximately ninety minutes of deliberations, the jury convicted  McMillon of all three offenses and entered special findings that  McMillon had committed each offense "for the purpose of  commercial advantage or private financial gain." As to the two  substantive transportation counts, the jury also entered special  findings that McMillon had acted as a principal rather than as an  aider-and-abettor.
