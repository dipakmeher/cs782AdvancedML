At  approximately 4:14:25    a.m. on June 12, 2014, McMillon and Williams arrived in the  tractor-trailer at an immigration checkpoint near Freer, Texas.  Williams was driving and McMillon was in the passenger seat. As the  tractor-trailer entered the checkpoint's primary inspection lane,  Border Patrol Agent Luis Pena ("Agent Pena") approached  the driver-side door and Border Patrol Agent Manuel Hernandez  ("Agent Hernandez") prepared to have his canine, Aroxa,  perform a sniff of the tractor-trailer's exterior. Agent Pena  identified himself and asked Williams if he minded opening the door  so that they could hear each other over the engine noise. Williams  obliged, and at approximately 4:14:35 a.m., Agent Pena climbed onto  the steps of the tractor below the driver's door, placing him at eye  level with Williams.
