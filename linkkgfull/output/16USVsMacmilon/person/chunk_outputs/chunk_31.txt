Finally,  McMillon points to inconsistencies in the Bluetooth evidence  identifying him at trial. As McMillon identifies, there was indeed  arguably conflicting evidence about the Bluetooth at trial—De La  Cruz and Hernandez-Gomez both testified that, at the parking lot, a  person wearing a Bluetooth instructed them to hide in the tractor,  and identified McMillon as that person; yet, Agent Pena and Agent  Camacho both testified that the Bluetooth was seized from Williams,  not McMillon, after the checkpoint stop. However, McMillon pressed  these inconsistencies (albeit, to no avail) to the jury in  cross-examinations and in closing argument. And, the aliens'  testimony is not factually impossible; rather, it is entirely  possible that McMillon was wearing the Bluetooth when the    aliens were picked up and that Williams was wearing it some period  of time later during the checkpoint stop. The jury was free to  choose this reasonable construction of the evidence and to gauge the  credibility of the testifying witnesses in doing so.   It is not    our role to second-guess the jury's credibility determinations on  appeal. See,  e.g., ("Jurors are free to choose among reasonable constructions of  the evidence, and retain the sole authority . . . to evaluate the  credibility of the witnesses. In other words, for the latter, it is  not our court's role . . . to second-guess the determinations of the  jury as to the credibility of the evidence." (internal  alterations and citations omitted)). Accordingly, we affirm  McMillon's conspiracy conviction.
