Aside  from the denial of his pretrial motions, McMillon also challenges  the sufficiency of the evidence on all three of his convictions.   Because he timely moved for acquittal as to each conviction, we  review McMillon's sufficiency challenges de  novo ,  and ask "whether, viewing all the evidence in the light most  favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have found that the  evidence established the elements of the offenses beyond a  reasonable doubt." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We draw all  reasonable inferences and make all credibility determinations "in  the light most favorable to the verdict." Id.
