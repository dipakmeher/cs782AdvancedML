McMillon's  run-in with the law arises from his travels through Texas with his  co-defendant Zeba Williams ("Williams"). The pair first  traveled from Houston to San  Antonio in a rental car "to do a construction job." Once in San  Antonio ,  Williams asked McMillon to accompany him in a tractor-trailer to  Laredo to pick up a piece of commercial equipment. Specifically,  McMillon testified that Williams asked him to ride along and "to  maybe help . . . drive back." McMillon did not drive the  tractor-trailer at any point on the way to Laredo but "guessed"  that he would have driven on the way back.
