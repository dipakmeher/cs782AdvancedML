At  sentencing, the district court clearly articulated that it was  denying McMillon's § 3B1.2 request because each of his minor-role  arguments were contradicted by Williams' live sentencing testimony  that he did not recruit McMillon to commit the offenses and that,  instead, the pair entered a joint partnership to smuggle  aliens .  This explanation alone was sufficient for the court to find that  McMillon's involvement in the offenses was that of an average  participant and that McMillon was not any less culpable than  Williams. See (   " asks whether a defendant's involvement is comparable to that of an  'average participant.'" (citation omitted)). In his brief,  McMillon makes no attempt to address Williams' testimony or the  district court's finding in this regard; instead, he merely  reiterates, without citing any sentencing or    trial evidence, that he was merely a passenger in the tractor; that  he did not make any arrangements in relation to transporting the  aliens; and that he possessed no managerial responsibilities. We  hold that the district court's reliance on Williams' testimony as  opposed to McMillon's unsupported arguments    was not clearly erroneous. See .  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of the § 3B1.2  adjustment.
