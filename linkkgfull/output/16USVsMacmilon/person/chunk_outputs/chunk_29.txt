At  trial, De La Cruz and Hernandez-Gomez—two of the unlawful aliens  discovered hidden in the tractor—testified that they entered the  United States with smugglers before they were eventually taken to an  empty parking lot where they were picked up by a tractor-trailer.  Both testified that, when the tractor-trailer arrived, a man wearing  a blinking cellular Bluetooth Device and white clothing motioned for  them to hide in the tractor, and both identified McMillon (sitting  at the    defense table) as this person. To complement the aliens' testimony  and in-court identification, the Government showed the jury a  photograph of McMillon wearing white on the night of the incident  and called Agent Pena and Agent Hernandez to narrate the checkpoint  stop for the jury. Viewed in the light most favorable to the  verdict, this evidence suggested that McMillon rode with Williams in  a tractor-trailer,    stopped at an empty parking lot where aliens were waiting, and  motioned for the aliens to hide in the tractor before attempting to  transport them through an immigration checkpoint. A reasonable jury  could have relied upon this evidence to find that McMillon agreed  with Williams to transport aliens and that McMillon had knowledge of  this arrangement and voluntarily participated in it.
