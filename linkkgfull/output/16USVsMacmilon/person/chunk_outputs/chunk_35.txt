For  the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's denial of  McMillon's motion to suppress; AFFIRM the court's denial of  McMillon's motion to dismiss; AFFIRM each of McMillon's convictions;  and AFFIRM the district court's denial of a § 3B1.2 adjustment at  sentencing.

*  Pursuant  to 5th  Cir. R. 47.5 ,  the court has determined that this opinion should not be published  and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set  forth in 5th  Cir. R. 47.5.4 .

1  McMillon  emphasizes that "Agent Pena required Williams to open the door  from the inception and he secured a position on the steps next to  Williams . . . as a show of authority that assured Williams and  McMillon could not leave until Agent Pena closed the door."  McMillon's attack on the voluntariness of Williams' consent is  belied by Williams' own suppression testimony that Agent Pena asked —not ordered —him  to open the door and that he knew he could refuse to do so if he  wished.
