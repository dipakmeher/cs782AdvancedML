B.  Proceedings Below

On  July 8, 2014, McMillon and Williams were charged by indictment with  one count of conspiracy to transport aliens within the United States  for commercial advantage or private financial gain, in violation of and ;    and two substantive counts of transporting aliens within the United  States for commercial advantage or private financial gain, in  violation of and .  Counts Two and Three specifically alleged that McMillon had  transported aliens Ramon De La Cruz ("De La Cruz") and  Jorge Miguel Hernandez-Gomez ("Hernandez-Gomez")—both of  whom were discovered hidden in the tractor's sleeper area—within  the United States.

Prior  to trial, McMillon moved to suppress all evidence seized from the  checkpoint stop, challenging both the duration of the stop and the  ensuing search of the tractor. After a two-day suppression hearing,  the district court denied the motion, concluding that neither the  duration of the stop nor the search of the tractor violated  McMillon's rights.
