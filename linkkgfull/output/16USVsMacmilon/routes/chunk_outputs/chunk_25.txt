Raymond McMillon makes two arguments to the contrary. He first argues that periods of delay related to his continuance motions cannot be excluded because the district court granted those motions without contemporaneously entering ends-of-justice findings. We have rejected a reading of as requiring contemporaneous ends-of-justice findings. See (rejecting the argument that the Speedy Trial Act requires contemporaneous ends-of-justice findings). Rather, the Act "merely requires that a district court enter on the record, at some point (presumably prior to trial), the necessary findings to support an ends-of-justice continuance;" that the findings "indicate when the motion was granted;" and "that the reasons stated be and can be fairly understood as being those that actually motivated the court at the time it granted the continuance." . Here, the district court's oral explanation at the January 20 hearing satisfied these conditions—the district court entered the necessary ends-of-justice findings before denying Raymond McMillon's motion to dismiss and before trial, identified by date and docket number the motions granted, and fairly explained the factors that motivated the district court when it granted the motions. Under Bieganowski , this is all that the Speedy Trial Act requires. See . Accordingly, Raymond McMillon's first argument fails.
