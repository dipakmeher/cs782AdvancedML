At trial, Ramon De La Cruz and Jorge Miguel Hernandez-Gomez—two of the unlawful aliens discovered hidden in the tractor-trailer—testified that they entered the United States with smugglers before they were eventually taken to an empty parking lot where they were picked up by a tractor-trailer. Both testified that, when the tractor-trailer arrived, Raymond McMillon wearing a blinking cellular Bluetooth Device and white clothing motioned for them to hide in the tractor-trailer, and both identified Raymond McMillon (sitting at the defense table) as this person. To complement the aliens' testimony and in-court identification, the Government showed the jury a photograph of Raymond McMillon wearing white on the night of the incident and called Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez to narrate the checkpoint stop for the jury. Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, this evidence suggested that Raymond McMillon rode with Zeba Williams in a tractor-trailer, stopped at an empty parking lot where aliens were waiting, and motioned for the aliens to hide in the tractor-trailer before attempting to transport them through Freer, Texas. A reasonable jury could have relied upon this evidence to find that Raymond McMillon agreed with Zeba Williams to transport aliens and that Raymond McMillon had knowledge of this arrangement and voluntarily participated in it.
