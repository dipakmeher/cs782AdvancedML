Agent Luis Pena began to question Zeba Williams and Raymond McMillon as Agent Manuel Hernandez was "working his dog." Agent Luis Pena asked Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams if they were United States citizens, and each confirmed that they were. Agent Luis Pena then questioned Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams about their travel plans. At approximately 4:15:07 a.m., as Zeba Williams responded to the travel question, Agent Manuel Hernandez told Agent Luis Pena to "check the back." Agent Luis Pena understood this to mean that Aroxa had alerted to the presence of contraband in the tractor-trailer.
