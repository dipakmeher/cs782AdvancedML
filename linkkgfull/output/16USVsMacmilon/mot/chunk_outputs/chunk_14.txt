Before addressing Raymond McMillon's arguments, we must consider a threshold question: whether Raymond McMillon, as a mere passenger in the tractor, has standing to challenge its search at Freer, Texas. We have consistently "recognized that 'passengers who assert neither a property nor a possessory interest in the automobile that was searched . . . have no legitimate expectation of privacy entitling them to the protection of the'" (alterations omitted) (quoting). Raymond McMillon argues that his agreement to help Zeba Williams drive the tractor-trailer "with a commercial purpose in mind" gave him a possessory interest in the tractor-trailer sufficient to confer standing at the district court. We need not reach this novel argument at the district court. Even assuming arguendo that Raymond McMillon has standing, each of his challenges to the search clearly fail at the district court.

Raymond McMillon's  first argument that Zeba Williams' consent was invalid because Luis Pena  prolonged the checkpoint stop at Freer, Texas fails for the reasons discussed supra .
