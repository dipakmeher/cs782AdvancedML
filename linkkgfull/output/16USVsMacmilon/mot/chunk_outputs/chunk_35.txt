At sentencing, the district court clearly articulated that it was denying Raymond McMillon's § 3B1.2 request because each of his minor-role arguments were contradicted by Zeba Williams' live sentencing testimony that he did not recruit Raymond McMillon to commit the offenses and that, instead, Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams entered a joint partnership to smuggle aliens. This explanation alone was sufficient for the district court to find that Raymond McMillon's involvement in the offenses was that of an average participant and that Raymond McMillon was not any less culpable than Zeba Williams. See ("asks whether a defendant's involvement is comparable to that of an 'average participant.'" (citation omitted)). In Raymond McMillon's brief, Raymond McMillon makes no attempt to address Zeba Williams' testimony or the district court's finding in this regard; instead, he merely reiterates, without citing any sentencing or trial evidence, that he was merely a passenger in the tractor; that he did not make any arrangements in relation to transporting the aliens; and that he possessed no managerial responsibilities. We hold that the district court's reliance on Zeba Williams' testimony as opposed to Raymond McMillon's unsupported arguments was not clearly erroneous. See. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of the § 3B1.2 adjustment.
