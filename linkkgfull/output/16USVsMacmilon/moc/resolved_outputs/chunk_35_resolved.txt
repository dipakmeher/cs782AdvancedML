At sentencing, the United States District Court clearly articulated that it was denying Ramon De La Cruz's § 3B1.2 request because each of his minor-role arguments were contradicted by Zeba Williams' live sentencing testimony that he did not recruit Ramon De La Cruz to commit the offenses and that, instead, Ramon De La Cruz and Zeba Williams entered a joint partnership to smuggle aliens. This explanation alone was sufficient for the United States District Court to find that Ramon De La Cruz's involvement in the offenses was that of an average participant and that Ramon De La Cruz was not any less culpable than Zeba Williams. See ("asks whether a defendant's involvement is comparable to that of an 'average participant.'" (citation omitted)). In Raymond McMillon's brief, Raymond McMillon makes no attempt to address Zeba Williams' live sentencing testimony or the United States District Court's finding in this regard; instead, he merely reiterates, without citing any sentencing or trial evidence, that he was merely a passenger in the tractor-trailer; that he did not make any arrangements in relation to transporting the aliens; and that he possessed no managerial responsibilities. We hold that the United States District Court's reliance on Zeba Williams' live sentencing testimony as opposed to Raymond McMillon's unsupported arguments was not clearly erroneous. See. Accordingly, we affirm the United States District Court's denial of the § 3B1.2 adjustment.
