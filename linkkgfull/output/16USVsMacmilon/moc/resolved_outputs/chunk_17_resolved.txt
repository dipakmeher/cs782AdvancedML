Having considered Ramon De La Cruz's arguments, we conclude that the immigration checkpoint stop and ensuing search of the tractor-trailer did not violate Ramon De La Cruz's rights. Accordingly, we affirm the United States District Court's denial of his motion to suppress.

II. Motion to Dismiss

Ramon De La Cruz next challenges the United States District Court's denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on Speedy Trial Act grounds, arguing that more than seventy days elapsed between his indictment and trial such that mandatory dismissal was required. We disagree.

A.

"The Speedy Trial Act is designed to ensure a federal defendant's right to a speedy trial . . . ." To achieve this end, "the Act requires that a defendant be tried within seventy non-excludable days of indictment. If more than seventy non-excludable days pass between the indictment and the trial, the 'indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.'" Id. (quoting). Recognizing that there can be valid reasons to delay a criminal trial, "the Act includes a long and detailed list of periods of delay that are excluded in computing the time within which trial must start." Several of these exclusions are at play in this appeal.
