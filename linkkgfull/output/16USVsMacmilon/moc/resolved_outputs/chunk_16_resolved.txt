Raymond McMillon's third argument that United States Border Patrol Agent's actions rendered Zeba Williams' consent involuntary similarly fails. Consent to a search must be knowing and voluntary "under the totality of the circumstances." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have articulated six primary factors to be considered in determining the voluntariness of consent: "(1) the voluntariness of the defendant's custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police procedure; (3) the extent and level of the defendant's cooperation with the police; (4) the defendant's awareness of his right to refuse consent; (5) the defendant's education and intelligence; and (6) the defendant's belief that no incriminating evidence will be found." . No single factor is dispositive. See .

Applying the Tedford factors, the United States District Court found, inter alia, that Zeba Williams was stopped at the time he consented but was not physically restrained or coerced; Zeba Williams was fully cooperative with United States Border Patrol Agent during the encounter; and Zeba Williams "appeared quite articulate on the stand," which "strongly indicated that he possessed sufficient intelligence to consent voluntarily." Viewing these findings with due regard to the United States District Court's opportunity to judge Zeba Williams' credibility at the suppression hearing, we conclude that the United States District Court's finding that Zeba Williams voluntarily consented to the search was not clearly erroneous.
