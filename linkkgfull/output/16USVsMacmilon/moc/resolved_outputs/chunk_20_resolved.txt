Applying these statutory exceptions and our case law, we hold that the United States District Court correctly concluded that less than seventy non-excludable days elapsed between Ramon De La Cruz's indictment and trial. Ramon De La Cruz's speedy trial clock began on July 8, 2014, the date of his indictment.

On August 12th, the United States District Court granted Ramon De La Cruz's second motion and extended the time for pretrial motions until August 18—the Speedy Trial Act clock remained tolled during this continuance period pursuant to.
