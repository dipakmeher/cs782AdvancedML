After hearing arguments from the parties, the United States District Court orally denied the motion to dismiss, and Ramon De La Cruz's trial began later the same day.

Although the computation is convoluted, we are convinced that only twenty-three non-excludable days elapsed from the date on which Ramon De La Cruz was indicted to the date on which his trial began—seventeen non-excludable days from indictment to first continuance motion and six additional non-excludable days from the denial of Raymond McMillon's motion to suppress to the filing of the motion to dismiss. Twenty-three non-excludable days between indictment and trial does not violate the Speedy Trial Act. See .
