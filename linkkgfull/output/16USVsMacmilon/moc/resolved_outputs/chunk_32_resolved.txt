Finally, Ramon De La Cruz points to inconsistencies in the cellular Bluetooth Device evidence identifying him at trial. As Ramon De La Cruz identifies, there was indeed arguably conflicting evidence about the cellular Bluetooth Device at trial—Ramon De La Cruz and Jorge Miguel Hernandez-Gomez both testified that, at the parking lot, a person wearing the cellular Bluetooth Device instructed them to hide in the tractor-trailer, and identified Ramon De La Cruz as that person; yet, United States Border Patrol Agent and Eric Camacho both testified that the cellular Bluetooth Device was seized from Zeba Williams, not Ramon De La Cruz, after the immigration checkpoint stop. However, Ramon De La Cruz pressed these inconsistencies (albeit, to no avail) to the jury in cross-examinations and in closing argument. And, the aliens' testimony is not factually impossible; rather, it is entirely possible that Ramon De La Cruz was wearing the cellular Bluetooth Device when the aliens were picked up and that Zeba Williams was wearing it some period of time later during the immigration checkpoint stop at Freer, Texas. The jury was free to choose this reasonable construction of the evidence and to gauge the credibility of the testifying witnesses in doing so. It is not our role to second-guess the jury's credibility determinations on appeal. See, e.g., ("Jurors are free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence, and retain the sole authority . . . to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. In other words, for the latter, it is not our court's role . . . to second-guess the determinations of the jury as to the credibility of the evidence." (internal alterations and citations omitted)). Accordingly, we affirm Ramon De La Cruz's conspiracy conviction in the United States District Court.
