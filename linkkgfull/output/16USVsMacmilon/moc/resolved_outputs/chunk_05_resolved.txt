As a courtesy, United States Border Patrol Agent asked Zeba Williams for consent to search the tractor-trailer's sleeper area, and Zeba Williams obliged. From where he was standing on the tractor-trailer's exterior steps, United States Border Patrol Agent peeked into the tractor-trailer's rear sleeper area and saw a fold-up bed cracked open at an odd angle. He asked Ramon De La Cruz to pull the bed down; Ramon De La Cruz got up from his seat and attempted to do so, but stated that the bed was stuck. United States Border Patrol Agent then entered the tractor-trailer and attempted to lower the bed himself, at which time he saw a person's face hidden between the bed and the tractor-trailer's wall. At approximately 4:16:09 a.m., United States Border Patrol Agent exited the tractor-trailer and informed United States Border Patrol Agent that "it was going to be positive for aliens sic smuggling."

The United States Border Patrol Agents, United States Border Patrol Agent and United States Border Patrol Agent, placed Zeba Williams and Ramon De La Cruz under arrest. During a subsequent search, United States Border Patrol Agents discovered a total of ten undocumented aliens hidden in the tractor-trailer's closets and the tractor-trailer's beds.
