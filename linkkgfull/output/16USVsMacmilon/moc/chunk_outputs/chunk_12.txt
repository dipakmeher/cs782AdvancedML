Citing our decision in Portillo-Aguirre, Raymond McMillon argues that the permissible length of the checkpoint stop ended once Luis Pena was subjectively satisfied that Zeba Williams and Raymond McMillon were United States citizens, i.e., after Luis Pena inquired about the pair's citizenship but before Luis Pena inquired about the pair's travel plans. See (distinguishing Machuca-Barrera and holding a checkpoint stop unconstitutional where a Border Patrol Agent "had completed his inspection before he turned his attention to drug interdiction," which "extended the stop for an additional three to five minutes"). However, notwithstanding the different factual scenarios between and this case, we have explicitly rejected the legal argument that Portillo-Aguirre created a "subjective motivation test" that supplanted the objective duration test articulated in Machuca-Barrera. See (reading Machuca-Barrera as holding "that so long as the primary programmatic purpose of the checkpoint was the detection of illegal immigrants, the permissible duration of a suspicionless detention there would be determined by objective factors, not by the subjective motivation or state of mind of the specific individual officers conducting the stop and related examination or questioning on the particular occasion at issue"). Rather, as discussed supra, dictates that we ask only whether the duration of the stop was objectively reasonable. See id. (discussing). Because thirty to forty seconds was an objectively reasonable duration, Luis Pena's questions did not impermissibly extend the stop.
