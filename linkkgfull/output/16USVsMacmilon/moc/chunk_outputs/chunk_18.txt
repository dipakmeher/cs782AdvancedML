First, the Speedy Trial Act excludes periods of "delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion." We have held that this particular "exclusion implicitly extends to 'that time after a hearing needed to allow the United States District Court to assemble all papers reasonably necessary to dispose of the motion, e.g., the submission of post-hearing briefs.'" (quoting). Second, once such papers are assembled, "the United States District Court has taken the motion 'under advisement' and thus has thirty excludable days in which to rule under another one of the statutory exclusions." Id. (citing). "The clock begins to tick again at the end of that thirty-day period, regardless of whether the United States District Court has ruled on the motion." Id. (quoting).
