Raymond McMillon next challenges the ensuing search of the tractor-trailer that led to the discovery of the aliens at Freer, Texas, asserting three reasons why Zeba Williams' consent was insufficient to justify the search: (1) Luis Pena had already prolonged the checkpoint stop at Freer, Texas beyond a permissible duration before Zeba Williams consented; (2) the video of the checkpoint stop at Freer, Texas played at the suppression hearing shows that Luis Pena initiated the search before Zeba Williams consented; and (3) Luis Pena's actions rendered Zeba Williams' consent involuntary.
