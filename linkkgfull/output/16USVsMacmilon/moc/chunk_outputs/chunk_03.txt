At approximately 4:14:25 a.m. on June 12, 2014, Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams arrived in the tractor-trailer at Freer, Texas. Zeba Williams was driving and Raymond McMillon was in the passenger seat. As the tractor-trailer entered Freer, Texas, United States Border Patrol Agent Luis Pena ("Luis Pena") approached the driver-side door and United States Border Patrol Agent Manuel Hernandez ("Manuel Hernandez") prepared to have his canine, Aroxa, perform a sniff of the tractor-trailer's exterior. Luis Pena identified himself and asked Zeba Williams if he minded opening the door so that they could hear each other over the engine noise. Zeba Williams obliged, and at approximately 4:14:35 a.m., Luis Pena climbed onto the steps of the tractor-trailer below the driver's door, placing him at eye level with Zeba Williams.
