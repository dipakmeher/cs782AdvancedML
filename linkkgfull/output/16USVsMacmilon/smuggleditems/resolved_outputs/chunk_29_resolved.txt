Aside from the denial of his pretrial motion, Ramon De La Cruz also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on all three of Ramon De La Cruz's convictions. Because he timely moved for acquittal as to each conviction, we review Ramon De La Cruz's sufficiency challenges de novo, and ask "whether, viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have found that the evidence established the elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We draw all reasonable inferences and make all credibility determinations "in the light most favorable to the verdict." Id.
