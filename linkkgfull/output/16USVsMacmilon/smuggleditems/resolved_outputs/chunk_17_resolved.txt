Applying the Tedford factors, the United States District Court found, inter alia, that Zeba Williams was stopped at the time he consented but was not physically restrained or coerced; Zeba Williams was fully cooperative with Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez during the encounter; and Zeba Williams "appeared quite articulate on the stand," which "strongly indicated that he possessed sufficient intelligence to consent voluntarily." Viewing these findings with due regard to the United States District Court's opportunity to judge Zeba Williams' credibility at the suppression hearing, we conclude that the United States District Court's finding that Zeba Williams voluntarily consented to the search was not clearly erroneous. See .

Having considered Ramon De La Cruz's arguments, we conclude that the immigration checkpoint stop and ensuing search of the tractor-trailer did not violate Ramon De La Cruz's rights. Accordingly, we affirm the United States District Court's denial of Ramon De La Cruz's motion to suppress.

II. Motion to Dismiss

Ramon De La Cruz next challenges the United States District Court's denial of Ramon De La Cruz's motion to dismiss the indictment on Speedy Trial Act grounds, arguing that more than seventy days elapsed between Ramon De La Cruz's indictment and Ramon De La Cruz's trial such that mandatory dismissal was required. We disagree.
