Applying these statutory exceptions and our case law, we hold that the United States District Court correctly concluded that less than seventy non-excludable days elapsed between Ramon De La Cruz's indictment and Ramon De La Cruz's trial. Ramon De La Cruz's Speedy Trial Act clock began on July 8, 2014, the date of Ramon De La Cruz's indictment. Seventeen non-excludable days then elapsed until Ramon De La Cruz filed his first pretrial motion to continue on July 25, which tolled the Speedy Trial Act clock pursuant to. On July 28th, the United States District Court granted Ramon De La Cruz's pretrial motion and extended the time for pretrial motions until August 11—the Speedy Trial Act clock remained tolled during this continuance period pursuant to. On August 12th, Ramon De La Cruz filed a second pretrial motion to continue, which again tolled the Speedy Trial Act clock pursuant to. On August 12th, the United States District Court granted Ramon De La Cruz's second pretrial motion and extended the time for pretrial motions until August 18—the Speedy Trial Act clock remained tolled during this continuance period pursuant to.
