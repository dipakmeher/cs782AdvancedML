After hearing arguments from the parties, the United States District Court orally denied Ramon De La Cruz's motion to dismiss the indictment, and Ramon De La Cruz's trial began later the same day.

Although the computation is convoluted, we are convinced that only twenty-three non-excludable days elapsed from the date on which Ramon De La Cruz was indicted to the date on which his trial began—seventeen non-excludable days from Ramon De La Cruz's indictment to first pretrial motion and six additional non-excludable days from the denial of Raymond McMillon's motion to dismiss the indictment to the filing of Ramon De La Cruz's motion to dismiss the indictment. Twenty-three non-excludable days between Ramon De La Cruz's indictment and Ramon De La Cruz's trial does not violate the Speedy Trial Act.
