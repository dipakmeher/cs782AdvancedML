Raymond McMillon makes two arguments to the contrary. He first argues that periods of delay related to his continuance motions cannot be excluded because the United States District Court granted those motions without contemporaneously entering ends-of-justice findings. We have rejected a reading of the Speedy Trial Act as requiring contemporaneous ends-of-justice findings. See (rejecting the argument that the Speedy Trial Act requires contemporaneous ends-of-justice findings). Rather, the Speedy Trial Act "merely requires that the United States District Court enter on the record, at some point (presumably prior to trial), the necessary findings to support an ends-of-justice continuance;" that the findings "indicate when the motion was granted;" and "that the reasons stated be and can be fairly understood as being those that actually motivated the United States District Court at the time it granted the continuance." . Here, the United States District Court's oral explanation at the January 20 hearing satisfied these conditions—the United States District Court entered the necessary ends-of-justice findings before denying Raymond McMillon's motion to dismiss the indictment and before Ramon De La Cruz's trial, identified by date and docket number the motions granted, and fairly explained the factors that motivated the United States District Court when it granted the motions. Under Bieganowski , this is all that the Speedy Trial Act requires. See . Accordingly, Ramon De La Cruz's first argument fails.
