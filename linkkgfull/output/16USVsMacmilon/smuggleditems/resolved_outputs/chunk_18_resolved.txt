"The Speedy Trial Act is designed to ensure Ramon De La Cruz's right to a speedy trial . . . .\" To achieve this end, \"the Speedy Trial Act requires that Ramon De La Cruz be tried within seventy non-excludable days of Ramon De La Cruz's indictment. If more than seventy non-excludable days pass between Ramon De La Cruz's indictment and Ramon De La Cruz's trial, the Ramon De La Cruz's indictment shall be dismissed on motion of Ramon De La Cruz.'\" Id. (quoting). Recognizing that there can be valid reasons to delay Ramon De La Cruz's trial, \"the Speedy Trial Act includes a long and detailed list of periods of delay that are excluded in computing the time within which Ramon De La Cruz's trial must start.\" Several of these exclusions are at play in Ramon De La Cruz's appeal.
