However, even generously assuming arguendo that we should exclude the "off the record" period identified by Ramon De La Cruz, there would still be no Speedy Trial Act violation. Assuming that the thirty-day exclusion period began upon the United States District Court's October 22 receipt of the first set of canine records, then it would have ended on November 20. Forty-five non-excludable days then elapsed between November 20 and January 5, the date on which the United States District Court ruled on Ramon De La Cruz's motion to suppress. Added to the seventeen non-excludable days and six non-excludable days discussed supra, this means that only sixty-eight non-excludable days would have elapsed. Because sixty-eight non-excludable days between Ramon De La Cruz's indictment and Ramon De La Cruz's trial complies with the Speedy Trial Act, see, Ramon De La Cruz's argument still fails. Accordingly, we affirm the United States District Court's denial of Ramon De La Cruz's motion to dismiss.
