Raymond McMillon's argument that Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez's actions rendered Zeba Williams' consent involuntary similarly fails. Consent to a search must be knowing and voluntary "under the totality of the circumstances." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have articulated six primary factors to be considered in determining the voluntariness of consent: "(1) the voluntariness of Ramon De La Cruz's custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police procedure; (3) the extent and level of Ramon De La Cruz's cooperation with the police; (4) Ramon De La Cruz's awareness of his right to refuse consent; (5) Ramon De La Cruz's education and intelligence; and (6) Ramon De La Cruz's belief that no incriminating evidence will be found." . No single factor is dispositive. See .
