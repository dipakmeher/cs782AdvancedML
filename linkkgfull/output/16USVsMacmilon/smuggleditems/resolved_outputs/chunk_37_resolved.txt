* Pursuant to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit R. 47.5, the United States District Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit R. 47.5.4.

1 Ramon De La Cruz emphasizes that "Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez required Zeba Williams to open the door from the inception and he secured a position on the steps next to Zeba Williams . . . as a show of authority that assured Ramon De La Cruz and Zeba Williams could not leave until Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez closed the door." Ramon De La Cruz's attack on the voluntariness of Zeba Williams' consent is belied by Zeba Williams' own suppression hearing testimony that Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez asked —not ordered—him to open the door and that he knew he could refuse to do so if he wished.
