On July 8, 2014, Ramon De La Cruz and Zeba Williams were charged by indictment with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens within the United States for commercial advantage or private financial gain, in violation of and; and two substantive counts of transporting aliens within the United States for commercial advantage or private financial gain, in violation of and. Counts Two and Three specifically alleged that Ramon De La Cruz had transported ten undocumented aliens—both of whom were discovered hidden in the tractor-trailer's sleeper area—within the United States.

Prior to Ramon De La Cruz's trial, Ramon De La Cruz moved to suppress all evidence seized from the immigration checkpoint stop, challenging both the duration of the immigration checkpoint stop and the ensuing search of the tractor-trailer. After a two-day suppression hearing, the United States District Court denied Ramon De La Cruz's motion to suppress, concluding that neither the duration of the immigration checkpoint stop nor the search of the tractor-trailer violated Ramon De La Cruz's rights.

Shortly thereafter, Ramon De La Cruz filed Ramon De La Cruz's motion to dismiss the indictment on Speedy Trial Act grounds, arguing that 104 non-excludable days had elapsed since the date of Ramon De La Cruz's indictment. The United States District Court also denied Ramon De La Cruz's motion to dismiss the indictment, reasoning that less than seventy non-excludable days had elapsed since Ramon De La Cruz's indictment.
