As a courtesy, Luis Pena asked Zeba Williams for Zeba Williams' consent to search the tractor-trailer's sleeper area, and Zeba Williams obliged. From where he was standing on the tractor-trailer's exterior steps, Manuel Hernandez peeked into the tractor-trailer's rear sleeper area and saw a fold-up bed cracked open at an odd angle. He asked Ramon De La Cruz to pull the bed down; Ramon De La Cruz got up from his seat and attempted to do so, but stated that the bed was stuck. Luis Pena then entered the tractor-trailer and attempted to lower the bed himself, at which time he saw ten undocumented aliens hidden between the bed and the tractor-trailer's wall. At approximately 4:16:09 a.m., Luis Pena exited the tractor-trailer and informed Manuel Hernandez that "it was going to be positive for ten undocumented aliens smuggling."
 
The United States Border Patrol Agents, Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez, placed Zeba Williams and Ramon De La Cruz under arrest. During a subsequent search of the tractor-trailer, Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez discovered a total of ten undocumented aliens hidden in the tractor-trailer's closets and the tractor-trailer's beds.
