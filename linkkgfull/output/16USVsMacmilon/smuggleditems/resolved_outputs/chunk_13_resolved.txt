Raymond McMillon next challenges the ensuing search of the tractor-trailer that led to the discovery of the ten undocumented aliens at the immigration checkpoint stop, asserting three reasons why Zeba Williams' consent was insufficient to justify the search of the tractor-trailer: (1) Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez had already prolonged the immigration checkpoint stop beyond a permissible duration before Zeba Williams' consent; (2) the checkpoint video played at the suppression hearing shows that Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez initiated the search of the tractor-trailer before Zeba Williams' consent; and (3) Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez's actions rendered Zeba Williams' consent involuntary.
