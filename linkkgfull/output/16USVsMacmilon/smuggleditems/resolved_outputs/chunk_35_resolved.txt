Generally, § 3B1.2 provides for varying reductions to Ramon De La Cruz's offense level if Ramon De La Cruz's participation in an offense was minimal, minor, or somewhere in between. We have noted that such adjustments are "generally appropriate only if Ramon De La Cruz is substantially less culpable than the average participant." (quoting). Raymond McMillon bears the burden of establishing entitlement to a § 3B1.2 adjustment. See.
