In light of these principles, it is clear that Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez did not extend the immigration checkpoint stop beyond its permissible duration. The United States District Court's factual findings, which are amply supported by the suppression testimony and thus not clearly erroneous, indicate that the countable duration of the stop—i.e., the time just before Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez made contact with Zeba Williams and Ramon De La Cruz at approximately 4:14:35 a.m. until Zeba Williams' consent to a search at approximately 4:15:07 a.m.—lasted about thirty or forty seconds. See ("We note initially that our inquiry considers only Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez's questioning of Ramon De La Cruz up to the point at which Ramon De La Cruz consented to a search of his tractor-trailer. After Ramon De La Cruz consented to a search, Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez needed no justification to prolong the encounter."). During this time, citizenship and travel plans questions were asked and answered, and Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez requested and received Zeba Williams' consent to a search. An immigration checkpoint stop lasting approximately thirty to forty seconds to allow Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez to ask citizenship and travel questions and to request consent for a search is of a sufficiently limited duration under our precedent. See, e.g., (approving an immigration checkpoint stop lasting "no more than a couple of minutes" during which Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez questioned occupants as to citizenship and travel plans and requested consent for a search); see also (per curiam) (holding that a stop "lasting no longer than one to one and one half minutes" was "within the time approved in Machuca-Barrera" and thus "did not exceed the permissible duration of an immigration stop"); (citing, inter alia, Machuca-Barrera and holding constitutional an immigration checkpoint stop that lasted "clearly less than half a minute").
