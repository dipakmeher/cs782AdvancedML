Raymond McMillon's run-in with the law arises from his travels through Texas with his co-defendant, Zeba Williams (Zeba Williams). Ramon De La Cruz and Zeba Williams first traveled from Houston to San Antonio in the rental car to do a construction job. Once in San Antonio, Zeba Williams asked Ramon De La Cruz to accompany him in the tractor-trailer to Laredo to pick up a piece of commercial equipment. Specifically, Ramon De La Cruz testified that Zeba Williams asked him to ride along and to maybe help . . . drive back. Ramon De La Cruz did not drive the tractor-trailer at any point on the way to Laredo but guessed that he would have driven on the way back.
