At approximately 4:14:25 a.m. on June 12, 2014, Ramon De La Cruz and Zeba Williams arrived in the tractor-trailer at the immigration checkpoint stop. Zeba Williams was driving and Ramon De La Cruz was in the passenger seat. As the tractor-trailer entered the immigration checkpoint stop, Luis Pena approached the driver-side door and Manuel Hernandez prepared to have his canine, Aroxa, perform a sniff of the tractor-trailer's exterior steps. Luis Pena identified himself and asked Zeba Williams if he minded opening the door so that they could hear each other over the engine noise. Zeba Williams obliged, and at approximately 4:14:35 a.m., Luis Pena climbed onto the tractor-trailer's exterior steps below the driver's door, placing him at eye level with Zeba Williams.
