Raymond McMillon is a defendant. Ramon De La Cruz is an Appellant.

PER CURIAM:

United States Border Patrol Agent at the immigration checkpoint stop discovered ten undocumented aliens hidden in the tractor-trailer in which Ramon De La Cruz was a passenger. Ramon De La Cruz was subsequently convicted of several alien transportation offenses and sentenced to a total of 41 months' imprisonment. He now appeals, challenging the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on the Speedy Trial Act grounds, the denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment, the sufficiency of the evidence on each of his convictions, and the denial of his request for a mitigated role adjustment at sentencing. Finding no error in the United States District Court's proceedings, we AFFIRM.
