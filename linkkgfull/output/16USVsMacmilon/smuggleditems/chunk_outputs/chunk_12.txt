Citing our decision in Portillo-Aguirre, Ramon De La Cruz argues that the permissible length of the immigration checkpoint stop ended once United States Border Patrol Agent was subjectively satisfied that Zeba Williams and Ramon De La Cruz were United States citizens, i.e., after United States Border Patrol Agent inquired about the pair's citizenship but before United States Border Patrol Agent inquired about the pair's travel plans. See (distinguishing Machuca-Barrera and holding a checkpoint stop unconstitutional where a United States Border Patrol Agent "had completed his inspection before he turned his attention to drug interdiction," which "extended the stop for an additional three to five minutes"). However, notwithstanding the different factual scenarios between and this case, we have explicitly rejected the legal argument that Portillo-Aguirre created a "subjective motivation test" that supplanted the objective duration test articulated in Machuca-Barrera. See (reading Machuca-Barrera as holding "that so long as the primary programmatic purpose of the immigration checkpoint was the detection of illegal immigrants, the permissible duration of a suspicionless detention there would be determined by objective factors, not by the subjective motivation or state of mind of the specific individual officers conducting the stop and related examination or questioning on the particular occasion at issue"). Rather, as discussed supra, dictates that we ask only whether the duration of the stop was objectively reasonable. See id. (discussing). Because thirty to forty seconds was an objectively reasonable duration, United States Border Patrol Agent's questions did not impermissibly extend the immigration checkpoint stop.
