Raymond McMillon's third argument that United States Border Patrol Agent's actions rendered Zeba Williams' consent involuntary similarly fails. Consent to a search must be knowing and voluntary "under the totality of the circumstances." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have articulated six primary factors to be considered in determining the voluntariness of consent: "(1) the voluntariness of the defendant's custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police procedure; (3) the extent and level of the defendant's cooperation with the police; (4) the defendant's awareness of his right to refuse consent; (5) the defendant's education and intelligence; and (6) the defendant's belief that no incriminating evidence will be found." . No single factor is dispositive. See .
