On January 20, 2015, a one-day jury trial commenced, at which the United States Government proffered testimony from, inter alia, United States Border Patrol Agent, United States Border Patrol Agent, Ramon De La Cruz, and Jorge Miguel Hernandez-Gomez. At the close of the United States Government's case-in-chief and at the close of evidence, Ramon De La Cruz moved for a Rule 29 judgment of acquittal on each offense alleged in the indictment. The United States District Court denied the motion on both occasions. After approximately ninety minutes of deliberations, the jury convicted Ramon De La Cruz of all three offenses and entered special findings that Ramon De La Cruz had committed each offense "for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain." As to the two substantive transportation counts, the jury also entered special findings that Ramon De La Cruz had acted as a principal rather than as an aider-and-abettor.
