Before addressing Ramon De La Cruz's arguments, we must consider a threshold question: whether Ramon De La Cruz, as a mere passenger in the tractor-trailer, has standing to challenge its search at the immigration checkpoint stop. We have consistently "recognized that 'passengers who assert neither a property nor a possessory interest in the automobile that was searched . . . have no legitimate expectation of privacy entitling them to the protection of the'" (alterations omitted) (quoting). Ramon De La Cruz argues that his agreement to help Zeba Williams drive the tractor-trailer "with a commercial purpose in mind" gave him a possessory interest in the tractor-trailer sufficient to confer standing at the United States District Court. We need not reach this novel argument at the United States District Court. Even assuming arguendo that Ramon De La Cruz has standing, each of his challenges to the search clearly fail at the United States District Court.

Ramon De La Cruz's first argument that Zeba Williams' consent was invalid because United States Border Patrol Agent prolonged the immigration checkpoint stop at the immigration checkpoint stop fails for the reasons discussed supra.
