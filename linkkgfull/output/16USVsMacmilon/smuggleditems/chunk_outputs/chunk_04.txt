Agent Luis Pena began to question Zeba Williams and Ramon De La Cruz as United States Border Patrol Agent was "working his dog." United States Border Patrol Agent asked Ramon De La Cruz and Zeba Williams if they were the United States Government citizens, and each confirmed that they were. United States Border Patrol Agent then questioned Ramon De La Cruz and Zeba Williams about their travel plans. At approximately 4:15:07 a.m., as Zeba Williams responded to the travel question, United States Border Patrol Agent told United States Border Patrol Agent to "check the tractor-trailer's rear sleeper area." United States Border Patrol Agent understood this to mean that Aroxa had alerted to the presence of contraband in the tractor-trailer.
