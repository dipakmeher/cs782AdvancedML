Raymond McMillon next challenges the ensuing search of the tractor-trailer that led to the discovery of the aliens at the immigration checkpoint stop, asserting three reasons why Zeba Williams' consent was insufficient to justify the search: (1) United States Border Patrol Agent had already prolonged the immigration checkpoint stop beyond a permissible duration before Zeba Williams consented; (2) the checkpoint video played at the suppression hearing shows that United States Border Patrol Agent initiated the search before Zeba Williams consented; and (3) United States Border Patrol Agent's actions rendered Zeba Williams' consent involuntary.
