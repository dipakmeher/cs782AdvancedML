The district court signed all of these proposed orders in each instance; however, I did not articulate specific findings regarding whether the ends of justice would have been met by granting those continuances that were requested by Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams. But the district court is going to make it abundantly clear, and I am clarifying that after I consider all the factors that are set forth in sic, each one of these continuances . . . was granted because the district court found that although this speedy trial case is not unusual or complex that it was unreasonable to expect adequate preparation in the time allotted for by the Speedy Trial Act, the failure to grant those continuances would have affected Raymond McMillon's ability to adequately prepare for this speedy trial case and would have denied all three of these Defendants reasonable time necessary for effective preparation.

In each instance, counsel for the respective Defendants articulated reasons why despite their respective due diligence they were unable to adequately prepare to file pretrial motions by the deadlines the district court had set. And the district court accepted those reasons that were given by Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams in whole. Thus the district court found that the ends of justice served by continuing the pretrial motions deadline for the specified period outweighed the best interest of the public and Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams in a speedy trial in each case.

After hearing arguments from the parties, the district court orally denied the motion to dismiss, and Raymond McMillon's trial began later the same day.
