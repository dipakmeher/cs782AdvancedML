At approximately 4:14:25 a.m. on June 12, 2014, Raymond McMillon and Zeba Williams arrived in the tractor-trailer at an immigration checkpoint near Freer, Texas. Zeba Williams was driving and Raymond McMillon was in the passenger seat. As the tractor-trailer entered the checkpoint's primary inspection lane, Border Patrol Agent Luis Pena ("Luis Pena") approached the driver-side door and Border Patrol Agent Manuel Hernandez ("Manuel Hernandez") prepared to have his canine, Aroxa, perform a sniff of the tractor-trailer's exterior. Luis Pena identified himself and asked Zeba Williams if he minded opening the door so that they could hear each other over the engine noise. Zeba Williams obliged, and at approximately 4:14:35 a.m., Luis Pena climbed onto the steps of the tractor below the driver's door, placing him at eye level with Zeba Williams.
