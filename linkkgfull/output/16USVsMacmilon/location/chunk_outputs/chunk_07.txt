On January 20, 2015, a one-day jury trial commenced, at which the Government proffered testimony from, inter alia, Luis Pena, Manuel Hernandez, Ramon De La Cruz, and Jorge Miguel Hernandez-Gomez. At the close of the Government's case-in-chief and at the close of evidence, Raymond McMillon moved for a Rule 29 judgment of acquittal on each offense alleged in the indictment. The court denied the motion on both occasions. After approximately ninety minutes of deliberations, the jury convicted Raymond McMillon of all three offenses and entered special findings that Raymond McMillon had committed each offense "for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain." As to the two substantive transportation counts, the jury also entered special findings that Raymond McMillon had acted as a principal rather than as an aider-and-abettor.

The case proceeded to sentencing. Based on a total offense level of 15 and a criminal history category of VI, Raymond McMillon's Presentence Investigation Report ("PSR") calculated a Guidelines-sentencing range of 41 to 51 months' imprisonment. Raymond McMillon objected and requested a two-point mitigated role adjustment to his offense level pursuant to . The district court denied Raymond McMillon's request and sentenced him to 41 months' imprisonment on each offense, to run concurrently.

Raymond McMillon timely appealed.
