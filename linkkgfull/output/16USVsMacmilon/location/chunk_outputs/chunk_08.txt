Raymond McMillon raises a host of issues on appeal. He first challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from the checkpoint stop. He next asserts that the court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds. Finally, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on each of his convictions as well as the district court's denial of a mitigating role adjustment at sentencing. We address each issue in turn.
