On August 18, events began transpiring that kept Raymond McMillon's speedy trial clock tolled for a substantial period of time. That day, Raymond McMillon filed a motion to suppress and a motion for discovery of, inter alia, canine records. On September 17, he filed amended versions of the same motions. On September 22, the court held a hearing on the motions, at which Raymond McMillon challenged the checkpoint stop and search and argued that the canine records were necessary to cross-examine Luis Pena and Manuel Hernandez regarding suppression. On September 24, the court sua sponte reconvened the suppression hearing to explore further Raymond McMillon's arguments and allowed the parties to file post-hearing briefs. On October 15, the court entered a discovery order, requiring the Government to produce the canine records for in camera inspection by October 22. Though the Government produced the records on the deadline, the court was unable to "fully read and understand" them; thus, the court requested additional information on December 11, which the Government provided on December 17. Raymond McMillon's speedy trial clock remained tolled during this entire period pursuant to, as per his request, the court gathered the papers necessary to gauge the checkpoint stop and the search so as to then adjudicate the suppression motion. See (noting that 's exclusion period "implicitly extends to that time after a hearing needed to allow the trial court to assemble all papers reasonably necessary to dispose of the motion" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).
