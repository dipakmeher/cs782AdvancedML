In the instant case, Reymundo Reyes approached IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR., "told him who he was, what the reason for the stop was, asked him for his driver's license and proof of insurance." At that point, Reymundo Reyes could see that "he was shaking, his hand was shaking a lot, and he . . . seemed extremely nervous, a little too nervous." Although IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. provided his driver's license, he was unable to provide proof of insurance, so IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "went around to the passenger side" to "look through the glove box" for it. After the search for proof of insurance for the vehicle came up fruitless, because of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s extreme nervousness, Reymundo Reyes asked "if he had any contraband" in the vehicle. Although IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. denied possessing contraband, he nonetheless gave Reymundo Reyes his consent to search the vehicle. 28 Although courts have recognized that "a detention may be of excessively long duration even though the officers have not completed and continue to pursue investigation of the matters justifying the stop's initiation," , the testimony given in this case indicates that within minutes of the initial contact, even before Reymundo Reyes received the results of the computer check, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. had consented to the search of his vehicle. See id. ("Because the officers were still waiting for the computer check at the time that they received consent to search the car, the detention to that point continued to be supported by the facts that justified its initiation."). Upon receiving consent, Reymundo Reyes informed IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. to "just hold on" while he contacted dispatch to "have somebody come" to conduct the search.
