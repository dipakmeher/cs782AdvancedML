"could have called a  family member to come and pick him up" from the nearby gas  station, and that he did not otherwise tell Defendant he had to  "stay around." (May 2nd Hr'g at 4:05 p.m.). IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR., on the other hand, testified that he did not feel free to  leave even after he was handed his citation because "he asked  the Freer patrolman, . . . what time what buses come over so he  could leave, and Officer Reymundo Reyes said he didn't know," but  that IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "needed to wait" for the Border  Patrol agents to arrive. (May 3rd Hr'g at 3:24, 3:27 p.m.).
