After Agent Rodriguez alerted to the two vehicles, Agent Trevino decided to go look into the vehicles, because lately the Border Patrol agents have noticed "a lot of drop-offs on FM 2050," where "vehicles with illegals . . . drop the illegal aliens off . .    . between the checkpoint and Bruni" so that the aliens can "then . . . walk east from Farm-to-Market Road 2050 all the way to Highway 16, and then they get picked up somewhere along Highway 16, and . . . go to Houston or San Antonio." (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:09 p.m.). These drop-offs are done "to avoid the two checkpoints," the Freer checkpoint on U.S. 59 and the Hebbronville checkpoint on U.S. 359. (Id. at 2:12 p.m.). A person could also drive "the loop" without encountering a checkpoint, because although FM 2050 intersects U.S. 59 to the west of Freer checkpoint, FM 2050 intersects U.S. 359 to the east of the Hebbronville checkpoint, such that "if someone were to want to avoid checkpoints, they would go U.S. 59, south down FM 2050, and then over to U.S. 359," which thereafter connects with Highway 16, allowing access to Houston or San Antonio to the north. (Id. at 2:12-2:13, 2:33, 2:58-2:59 p.m.). 

Replaced "Agent Rodriguez" with "IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR." and "Agent Trevino" with "Jorge Luis Trevino". The correct replacement for "Agent Rodriguez" is indeed "IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR." based on the provided RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary.
