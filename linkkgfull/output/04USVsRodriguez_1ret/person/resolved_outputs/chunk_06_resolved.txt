Agent Jorge Luis Trevino further testified that FM 2050 is otherwise "just ranches," so the "only vehicles . . . going southbound and northbound on FM 2050 are . . . oilfield trucks, tankers, utility trucks, F-150s, F-250s —that's what most of the ranchers use." (Id. at 2:14-2:15 p.m.). He noted that it was "very uncommon" for multiple cars to be turning down FM 2050 together, because vehicles on FM 2050 are "mostly ranchers and oil trucks, and if you're going to see a truck in tandem, it's going to be an oil field truck." (Id. at 2:16, 3:30 p.m.). Agent Jorge Luis Trevino acknowledged that there are also "small cars" on FM 2050 due to the presence of a "wind farm" on the road, but stated that although Border Patrol agents "don't know the people" in those cars, they "know the vehicles, because they drive every single day to work." (Id. at 2:16-2:17 p.m.). Those employees often drive "through the checkpoint, and as soon as they get inspected, they turn around and go back on FM 2050." (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:17 p.m.). When asked what percentage of the vehicles on FM 2050 he recognizes, Agent Jorge Luis Trevino stated that "ninety, ninety-five percent" of the vehicles are "farmers and oil field workers." (Id. at 2:17-2:18 p.m.). Those vehicles that he does not recognize he will "go out and at least take a look at them." (Id. at 2:18 P.m.).
