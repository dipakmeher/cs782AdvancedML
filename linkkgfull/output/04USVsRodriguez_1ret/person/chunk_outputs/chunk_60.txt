27  Although  the testimony elicited during the hearing described FM 2050 as  having no shoulder and as "real narrow" with "sharp  turns," (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:24 p.m.), the testimony also  indicated that Agent Trevino could drive this "real narrow"  road at eighty miles per hour. Thus, the undersigned still gives  credence to the fact that Agent Trevino thought the Defendants'  driving was an aberration from the norm, and "made him  believe that the drivers were nervous because he was behind  them." Additionally, although Ricardo Rodriguez testified  otherwise, he qualified his testimony with statements such as "  I'm pretty sure it did not" and "I don't . . . think I got  off the road." Although credible, Defendant's testimony was  much more speculative than Agent Trevino's, and thus his testimony  does not call into question the validity of Agent Trevino's  observations. Notably, neither Defendant contested the fact that  Ignacio Rodriguez's vehicle was driving "on and off the road."

28  Defendant  acknowledged during the hearing that he consented to have his  vehicle searched, and thus the validity of the consent is not at  issue.
