The  Supreme Court has repeatedly refused to authorize investigative  interrogations at law enforcement stations on less than probable  cause or consent. See,  e.g., ; .  In the present case, Defendant's involuntary transportation to the  Border Patrol station for questioning was "sufficiently like  an arrest to invoke the traditional rule that arrests may  constitutionally be made only on probable cause." .  The pertinent inquiry therefore becomes whether Agent Benavides had  probable cause to arrest Defendant at the time of the traffic stop.
