Agent  Trevino further testified that, as he followed the white sedan, "all  of the five passengers in that vehicle were just sitting straight,  just stiff, not looking, not communicating with each other."  ( Id. at 2:22 p.m.). Although Agent Trevino also stated that the  passengers "all looked . . . packed in the vehicle," he  acknowledged on cross examination that the white Malibu was in fact  "designed to hold that many people," with "two . . .  sitting in front and three in back." ( Id. at 2:24, 3:05, 3:13 p.m.). He noted that the white vehicle, too, was  "going on and off the road," 10 "probably about three times, two times" over "not a  very far distance," and the fact that "the vehicles went  off the road . . . made him believe that the drivers were  nervous because he was behind them." ( Id. at 2:22 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:10, 1:16 p.m.). The white car also  appeared to be "riding low," and "half of its  passengers were    wearing caps." 11 (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:22-2:23 p.m.). All of these observations were  made as the "sun was going down" 12 and "from behind the vehicle," not from the side, because,  as previously noted, FM 2050 consists of only two lanes. ( Id. at 2:23-2:24, 3:08, 3:10, 3:12 p.m.).
