Lastly,  the number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers of a vehicle  also factors into the reasonable suspicion analysis. During the  hearing, Agent Trevino explained that "all of the five  passengers in that vehicle were just sitting straight, just  stiff,    not looking, not communicating with each other." Although the  vehicle had five visible passengers, the sedan was in fact "designed  to hold that many people." Additionally, as mentioned before,  all of Agent Trevino's observations of the passengers were made from  the rear of the vehicle, because of the nature of the roadway. Any  determination as to whether the passengers in a vehicle are  conversing or not, based on the vantage point Agent Trevino had,  seems tenuous at best, and thus no weight is afforded this  observation. Agent Trevino also noted that "half of the  passengers were wearing caps." However, "a factual  condition that is consistent with alien  smuggling does not provide reasonable suspicion if that condition also occurs  even more frequently in the law-abiding public." .  This observation, too, adds nothing to the reasonable suspicion for  the stop. Therefore, the eighth Brignoni-Ponce factor does nothing to favor the reasonableness of the roving Border  Patrol stop. Nonetheless, "under a totality of the  circumstances analysis, the absence of a particular factor will not  control a court's conclusions." .
