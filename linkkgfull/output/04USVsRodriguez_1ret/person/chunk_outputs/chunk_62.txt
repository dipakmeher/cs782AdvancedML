30  The  undersigned briefly notes that Ignacio Rodriguez did testify that he  asked Officer Reyes "what time the buses come over so that  he could leave," but was told that he "needed to wait."  When he asked why he could not leave, Officer Reyes allegedly told  him that the "canine was coming" to search the vehicle.  This testimony conflicts with that of Officer Reyes, who stated that  he never told Defendant that he needed to "stay around"  and was not otherwise asked about any bus schedule. Based on  Defendant's conflicting testimony, see  supra note 20, and therefore his questionable credibility, the undersigned  chooses to afford weight to Officer Reyes's account of the events,  and finds that entirety of the search was consensual. Even if the  undersigned were to give weight to Ignacio Rodriguez's testimony  that he was detained against his will until Agent Benavides showed  up "twenty, twenty-five" minutes later, the undersigned  nonetheless finds that Officer Reyes had reasonable suspicion to  detain Defendant until Border Patrol's arrival. Officer Reyes  testified that he was aware that Border Patrol agents had  "encountered . . . a white passenger vehicle . . . with  illegal aliens" and that "there was a black truck with it,  but that it was unknown what the truck's involvement was."  (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:40 p.m.). Officer Reyes also testified that  Defendant was extremely nervous despite being informed that he had  committed only a minor traffic infraction; Defendant could not  verify the owner of the vehicle, and changed his story as to who it  belonged to; Defendant could not provide any proof of insurance; and  Defendant acknowledged that he was traveling to Dallas from Laredo,  but was nonetheless taking a notably roundabout route. All of these  facts provided sufficient reasonable suspicion to temporarily detain  Defendant. See  (citing    .
