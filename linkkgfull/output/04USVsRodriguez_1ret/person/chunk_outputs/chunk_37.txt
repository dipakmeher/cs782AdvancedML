Shortly  thereafter dispatch advised Officer Reyes that the "owner of  the vehicle was a female," and so he asked Ignacio Rodriguez  "whose vehicle it was, and he said it was his aunt's vehicle."  Defendant then stated that it "belonged to his cousin"    instead. Officer Reyes therefore inquired into Ignacio Rodriguez's  travel plans, and he stated that he was "coming from Laredo,  and he was going to Dallas, Texas," a statement which raised  Officer Reyes's suspicions because of the route being driven. All of  Officer Reyes's questions came prior to his issuing the citation,  and fall within the ambit of what is permissible under the ,  as the Fifth Circuit "has consistently approved a police  officer's questioning a driver's travel plans where the driver was  not the authorized vehicle lessee or otherwise appeared to lack  driving authority." (stating also that lamn officer may also ask about the purpose and  itinerary of a driver's trip during the traffic stop."). These  questions "may efficiently determine whether a traffic  violation has taken place, and if so, whether a citation or warning  should be issued or an arrest made." Id. Here, significantly, "the questioning did nothing to extend the  duration of the initial, valid seizure." .
