26  Additionally,  had the Defendants wanted to travel to Bruni at the southern  terminus of FM 2050 or to one of the ranches at the southern end of  FM 2050, or instead travel to Hebbronville or any other location on  U.S. 359, the most direct route out of Laredo would have been U.S.  359, which travels in an easterly direction, instead of traveling  northeast on U.S. 59 before turning directly south onto FM 2050. Or  had Defendants originated their journey outside of Laredo, where  U.S. 359 was not immediately accessible, perhaps at Ranchitos Las  Lomas on U.S. 59, the more direct route to Bruni would still not be  FM 2050, but rather another Farm-to-Market Road called FM 2895. The  only advantage of taking the indirect route of U.S. 59 to FM 2050  is, as indicated previously, to avoid the Hebbronville checkpoint on  U.S. 359. See (taking note of the fact that the route taken by the defendant  "would not be the most direct route," but would rather "be  a route designed to avoid stationary checkpoints").
