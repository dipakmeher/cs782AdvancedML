The  fifth Brignoni-Ponce factor a court must consider is the agent's previous experience in  detecting illegal activity, for "in all situations the  officer is entitled to assess the facts in light of his experience  in detecting illegal entry and smuggling." ; see  also ("Reasonable suspicion takes its fact-driven meaning from the  totality of the circumstances known to the agent, and the agent's  experience    in evaluating such circumstances."). In the instant case, Agent  Trevino has been with the United States Border Patrol since May 29,  2006. Even more significant is the fact that he has been working at  the Freer checkpoint "two or three days out of the week"  since August of 2011, which has led him to now recognize "ninety  to ninety-five percent" of the vehicles passing down FM 2050. Compare (determining that the knowledge of two Border Patrol agents, one  with six years and one with three and a half years of experience,  "fourteen months of which had been spent patrolling" the  particular area of highway where the vehicle was encountered, to be  "of considerable importance in evaluating the totality of the  circumstances" in that case), and (factoring into the reasonable suspicion analysis that "the  agents, who were familiar with area residents, did not recognize  the defendant's truck as a local vehicle."), and (noting that the agent "had patrolled the road for a year and  was very familiar with the traffic."), with   (in granting the motion to suppress, giving "substantial weight  to the fact that the agents were new to the area and were not  familiar with the residents, their vehicles    or traffic patterns," because the agents had only one week of  experience patrolling the specific highway). Because an agent's  "knowledge of and experience in an area, while not  independently sufficient, is . . . entitled to some weight in an  evaluation of whether the stop was supported by reasonable  suspicion," ,  Agent's Trevino nearly seven years with the Border Patrol, with a  year and a half of that time stationed at the Freer checkpoint,  tends to support the stop in the instant case.
