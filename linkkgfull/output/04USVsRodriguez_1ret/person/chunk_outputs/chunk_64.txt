32  Confusingly,  Defendant appeared to concede as much, when during the cross  examination of Agent Benavides, he was able to get the agent to  agree to all of the following statements: "Okay, but you . . .  were at the same location where Officer Reyes had stopped him to  give him a traffic citation, . . . and by that time, you knew that  there was a black truck, you knew that the driver was a last name  Rodriguez, and you knew that the truck was registered to somebody in  Corinth, Texas." (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:54 p.m.). "And you had  been listening to the radio about the stop that Agent Trevino made  on the sedan, and that he had also caught, or found, five or six  illegal aliens . . . in the vehicle." ( Id. ).  "So, by that time, you had information sufficient to arrest Mr.  Rodriguez on the spot once you arrived." ( Id. ).

33  Defendant  does not appear to argue that there was any Miranda violation or that Agent Montemayor somehow infringed upon his  constitutional rights, and therefore that issue is left unaddressed.
