Prior to Agent Benavides's arrival at the location of the traffic stop on Farm-to-Market Road 2050, he knew that Agent Trevino had "encountered some illegals" in a white sedan on Farm-to-Market Road 2050. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:29 p.m.). Agent Benavides's supervisor had also informed him that Agent Trevino "had encountered a 'LIS,' the code for smuggling aliens, in the car," and that the driver, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR., had been arrested. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:31-1:32 p.m.). Agent Trevino had encountered the illegal aliens only after running "another license plate, for a black truck Dodge" that "kept going straight towards U.S. Highway 359" after Agent Trevino pulled over the sedan. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:29 p.m.). Agent Trevino had therefore radioed for United States Border Patrol agents, and particularly Agent Benavides because of his location on Highway 16, "to be on the lookout for that type of a truck." (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:30 p.m.). Significantly, the black truck's registered owner and the driver of the white sedan, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR., had the same last name—RODRIGUEZ, a fact that was known to Agent Benavides before he made contact with IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:30, 1:31 p.m.). He was also aware of the fact that the two vehicles, one out of Corinth, Texas and one out of Dallas, Texas "were riding in tandem." (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:30 p.m.). During the hearing, Agent Benavides stated that he "remembers that the two cities are close by." (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:30 p.m.). Finally, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. conceded that he was traveling to Dallas, Texas, a statement which validated the United States Border Patrol agents' suspicions regarding the route being driven by the two vehicles.
