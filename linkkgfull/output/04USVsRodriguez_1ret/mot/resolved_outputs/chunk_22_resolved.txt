After communication with his supervisor, Agent Benavides then "just told IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. that he needed to go with him to the Freer immigration checkpoint for further questioning, and that he was going to transport him to the Freer immigration checkpoint," and also advised Officer Reyes of the same. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:47 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:50, 1:52, 2:42, 3:26 p.m.). Agent Benavides stated that he "didn't give Defendant the option" to leave, but rather "just told Defendant that 'you're going to come to the Freer immigration checkpoint for further questioning,'" whereby IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "agreed to come . . . ." (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:52 p.m.). Agent Benavides's and IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s testimony made clear that "Agent Benavides didn't ask Defendant for permission or nothing; he just told him" he was going to the Freer immigration checkpoint for questioning. (Id. at 2:42, 3:26 p.m.). It was around this time when Agent Benavides also learned that IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s black Dodge pickup truck was going to be impounded. (Id. at 2:40 p.m.). Agent Benavides then "kind of escorted IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. to his unit, and Defendant freely went inside" the vehicle without asking any questions; Agent Benavides then drove to the Freer immigration checkpoint 18 miles away and placed Defendant inside the checkpoint, in "an open area at Freer immigration checkpoint" with other agents nearby, before he "took off" and returned to his assigned area. (Id. at 1:58, 2:42-2:44 p.m.). Agent Benavides never informed IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. that he was under arrest and no handcuffs were used. (Id. at 1:46, 1:47, 2:43 p.m.).
