27 Although the testimony elicited during the hearing described Farm-to-Market Road 2050 as having no shoulder and as "real narrow" with "sharp turns," (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:24 p.m.), the testimony also indicated that Agent Trevino could drive this "real narrow" road at eighty miles per hour. Thus, the undersigned still gives credence to the fact that JORGE LUIS TREVINO thought the Defendants' driving was an aberration from the norm, and "made him believe that the drivers were nervous because he was behind them." Additionally, although RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. testified otherwise, he qualified his testimony with statements such as "I'm pretty sure it did not" and "I don't . . . think I got off the road." Although credible, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s testimony was much more speculative than JORGE LUIS TREVINO's, and thus his testimony does not call into question the validity of JORGE LUIS TREVINO's observations. Notably, neither of the Defendants contested the fact that IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, which is the black Dodge pickup truck, was driving "on and off the road."

28 IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. acknowledged during the hearing that he consented to have his vehicle, the black Dodge pickup truck, searched, and thus the validity of the consent is not at issue.
