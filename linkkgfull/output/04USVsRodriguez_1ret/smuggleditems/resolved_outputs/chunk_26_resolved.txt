About a mile and a half south of the wind farm near Farm-to-Market Road 2050, past San Pablo Road, United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino initiated a stop of RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle because of all of those facts together. ( Id. at 3:00 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:09, 1:11 p.m.). As he activated his overhead lights, the vehicle once again went just a little bit off the road, just as it had several times before. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:25 p.m.). Once RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle was stopped, United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino approached RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle and identified himself as a United States Border Patrol agent. ( Id. at 2:24-2:25 p.m.). The driver of RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR., informed United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino that he was a United States citizen. ( Id. at 2:25 p.m.). When he inquired into the citizenship of the passengers, they first did not acknowledge him and continued to look straight, but ultimately acknowledged they were all Mexicans. ( Id. at 2:25-2:26 p.m.). United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino counted how many were in RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle and then asked if anyone else was in RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, to which RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. responded that there were two more in the trunk. ( Id. at 2:26 p.m.). The trunk passengers also admitted that they were in the country illegally. ( Id. at 2:26-2:27 p.m.). Once United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino realized that RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle was transporting undocumented aliens, he put information over the United States Border Patrol radio to be on the lookout for IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, which had passed him going southbound on Farm-to-Market Road 2050 during the stop of RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, since he believed that both of them were connected because the two vehicles were out of Dallas, Texas and because both the vehicles were riding in tandem south on Farm-to-Market Road 2050. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:27-2:28, 3:23-3:25 p.m.).
