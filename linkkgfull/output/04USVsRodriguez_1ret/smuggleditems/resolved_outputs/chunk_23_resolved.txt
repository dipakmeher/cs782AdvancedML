After catching up to RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle and calling the license plate in to Freer Police Department, "the second vehicle came back . . . out of Dallas, Texas," as a rental car from Hertz Rental Car Company. (Id. at 2:15, 2:19, 3:32 p.m.). United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino explained that, "from his experience, a lot of . . . smugglers use the rental cars used by smugglers, so that if they get caught or busted, they don't lose one of their own vehicles, they lose . . . a rental car used by smugglers." (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:10 p.m.). United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino additionally testified that he thought it "odd why those two vehicles from out of town were on this road," and it therefore appeared to him that "those vehicles . . . had ties together" and "both . . . were riding in tandem south on Farm-to-Market Road 2050." (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:15-2:16, 2:27-2:28, 3:31 p.m.). The two out-of-town vehicles raised United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino's suspicions because Farm-to-Market Road 2050 "doesn't go anywhere; it's just a connection between U.S. Highway 359 and U.S. Highway 59;" he therefore questioned what "two vehicles out of Dallas, Texas were doing on Farm-to-Market Road 2050 going southbound, when Dallas, Texas is northbound, north of San Antonio," noting that the most direct route to Dallas, Texas or San Antonio would be Interstate 35. (Id. at 2:18-2:19 p.m.).
