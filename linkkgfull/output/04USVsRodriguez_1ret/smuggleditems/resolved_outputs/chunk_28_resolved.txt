Ignacio Rodriguez pulled into a nearby parking lot, where Officer Reymundo Reyes then "made contact with the driver, . . . told him who he was, what the reason for the stop was, and asked him for his driver's license and proof of insurance." (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:38 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:23 p.m.). Officer Reymundo Reyes testified that as IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. pulled out his wallet for his driver's license, "he was shaking, his hand was shaking a lot, and he . . . seemed extremely nervous, a little too nervous," especially considering that he had been informed that he was pulled over for failing to use a turn signal. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:39-3:40 p.m.). Although he provided a driver's license, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. could not immediately find any insurance; he therefore "got out of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle and went around to the passenger side, and there on the passenger side was looking through the glove box," but was ultimately unable to provide any proof of insurance. ( Id. at 3:38-3:39 p.m.). As IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "came back" from the passenger side of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, Officer Reymundo Reyes asked him "if he had anything in IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, any contraband or anything like that," to which Defendant responded in Spanish, 'no I don't have anything . . . you can search it.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:45 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:33-3:35, 3:49 p.m.). Officer Reymundo Reyes informed him to "just hold on" while he contacted Freer Police Department for a canine, 15 and IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. did not ask any questions as to how long the search might take. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:44 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:34, 3:49 p.m.).
