When Officer Reymundo Reyes soon thereafter advised Officer Reymundo Reyes that the "owner of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle was a female, he asked IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. whose IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle it was, and he said it was his aunt's IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle." (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:41, 3:54 p.m.). Officer Reymundo Reyes also inquired into IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s travel plans, and he stated that he was "coming from Laredo, Texas, and he was going to Dallas, Texas," a statement which raised Officer Reymundo Reyes's suspicions, because "from Laredo, Texas to Dallas, Texas, the best route is Interstate 35, and he was . . . taking Highway 16 towards San Antonio." (Id. at 3:41-3:42 p.m.). Officer Reymundo Reyes again asked about the owner of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, and IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "changed that it was from his aunt to that it belonged to his cousin." (Id. at 3:43 p.m.). All of Officer Reymundo Reyes's questions came prior to his issuing the ticket. (Id. at 4:04 p.m.). Because IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "couldn't provide any insurance information, as soon as . . . Officer Reymundo Reyes couldn't determine who the owner of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle was, . . . it was at that point that he didn't know if IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle was possibly stolen" and therefore decided to impound IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle. (Id. at 3:43-3:44 p.m.). The decision to impound IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle was made "at the moment that Officer Reymundo Reyes was writing his citation," which was "approximately five minutes" after Officer Reymundo Reyes had made contact with IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. (Id. at 3:46, 3:59 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:44-3:45 p.m.). Officer Reymundo Reyes finished writing the citation after another three to five minutes and then returned the Defendant's driver's license. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:56, 4:05 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:24 p.m.). Although he "was going to let IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. go," Officer Reymundo Reyes testified that he "wasn't going to allow IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle to continue to its destination." (May 2nd Hr'g at 4:05 p.m.).
