4  The  testimony described Farm-to-Market Road 2050 as a paved road with  only two lanes, one in each direction. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:35-2:36  p.m.; see May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Ex. 12). United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino also testified that  "there's no shoulder" on Farm-to-Market Road 2050, so any vehicle straying  from the lane on Farm-to-Market Road 2050 "will pick up rocks and dust." (May 2nd Hr'g  at 2:22, 2:35 p.m.). The United States Department of Homeland Security therefore interprets Jorge Luis Trevino's  statements that the vehicles went "off the shoulder" to be  interchangeable with the statements that the vehicles went "off  the road."

5  Jorge Luis Trevino explained that most of the "vehicles that he  encounters are Ford F-150s, Ford F-250s with their head  rack in the back." (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:11 p.m.). He continued:  "If you look at the oil companies, most of them use Ford F-150s,  white; they don't use Dodge Rams. That's how I distinguish them."  ( Id. at 1:12 p.m.).
