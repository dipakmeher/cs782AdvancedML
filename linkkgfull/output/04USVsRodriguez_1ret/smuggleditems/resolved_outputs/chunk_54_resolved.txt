Of course the inquiry cannot end here, as IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. also contends that he was subject to an "unlawful arrest" because there was no probable cause to arrest him. As indicated above, United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides arrived at the scene of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle stop on Farm-to-Market Road 2050 as Officer Reymundo Reyes was issuing his citation. He approached IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR., presented himself as a United States Border Patrol agent, and inquired into IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s citizenship and travel plans as "routine questions." United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides then awaited the results of the canine search before informing IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "that he needed to go with him to the Freer Immigration Checkpoint for further questioning, and that he was going to transport him to the Freer Immigration Checkpoint." The testimony made explicit that United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides "didn't give IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. the option" to leave, but rather "just told IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. that 'you're going to come to the Freer Immigration Checkpoint for further questioning,' whereby IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "agreed to come . . . ." United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides then escorted IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. into the back seat of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle and drove to the Freer Immigration Checkpoint eighteen miles away, placing IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. inside the Freer Immigration Checkpoint, in "an open area at Freer Immigration Checkpoint" with other United States Border Patrol agents nearby, sometime between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides never informed IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. that he was under arrest and no handcuffs were used. At some point, however, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. was placed "in a holding cell at Freer Immigration Checkpoint," behind a locked sliding door, and remained there until Marco Montemayor interviewed him around 11:30 p.m.
