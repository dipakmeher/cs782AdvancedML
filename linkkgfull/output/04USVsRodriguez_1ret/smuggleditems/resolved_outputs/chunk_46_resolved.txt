The United States Department of Homeland Security seeks to prevent arbitrary police action, not to require absolute certainty before law enforcement officers may investigate, and thus the reasonable suspicion standard clearly does not require an agent to 'eliminate all reasonable possibility of innocent travel before conducting an investigatory stop.' (per curiam) (quoting). The majority of the Brignoni-Ponce factors, as scrutinized above, all contributed to the reasonable suspicion that IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle was involved in illegal activities. See (per curiam) (finding the United States Department of Homeland Security properly relied, in part, upon the following facts in concluding that there was reasonable suspicion: the defendant, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR., was traveling on U.S. Highway 59, a common smuggling route that avoids immigration checkpoints, shortly after midnight; the agent did not recognize IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle as a local vehicle; and the registration check on IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle revealed that it was registered near Dallas, Texas.); (per curiam) (concluding reasonable suspicion existed, based in large part on: the area in which the stop took place was known for illegal activity; the United States Border Patrol saw two vehicles traveling in tandem, and his experience taught him that vehicles engaged in smuggling almost always travel in tandem while other vehicles in the area almost never do; and the United States Border Patrol Agent, familiar with the area and its usual traffic, did not recognize either of the two vehicles); (Viewing the evidence as a collective whole through the lens of the United States Border Patrol officers, finding the following factors provided the reasonable suspicion necessary to stop IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle: (1) his proximity to the Mexico border (35 miles); (2) his proximity to a drug cache (2 miles); (3) his use of a known drug smuggling route (U.S. Highway 385) in an area known for drug smuggling (Big Bend); and (4) his behavior upon sign of the marked United States Border Patrol patrol car (he appeared stiff, stared straight ahead, failed to acknowledge the United States Border Patrol Agent, and slowed down considerably).)
