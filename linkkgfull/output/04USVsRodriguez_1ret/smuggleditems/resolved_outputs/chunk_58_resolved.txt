Although the United States Department of Homeland Security has addressed similar cases, courts in other circuits have delineated a concise standard with which to analyze such cases. "Sufficient evidence that two vehicles are driving in tandem plus evidence that one vehicle contains contraband can provide probable cause sufficient to support arresting the driver of the other vehicle." Compare (determining there was "considerable objective evidence" that RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle and IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle were driving in tandem when both were "a mere two car lengths apart on an Interstate highway in very light traffic during the predawn hours of the morning" and the first vehicle to be pulled over "seemingly waited for the other vehicle to elude the officer's range of vision before pulling over"), and (concluding that the "sequentially numbered, out-of-state specialty license plates" on RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle and IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle traveling in tandem indicated a sufficient connection between the vehicles to arrest the driver of the second vehicle after determining the first vehicle contained "a false compartment beneath the floor") with (finding "insufficient facts to demonstrate that IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle was driving in tandem with the Cadillac" when the facts indicated only that "both vehicles had Arizona plates and both were heading toward Arizona on an Interstate highway," with the court noting that "this is not an instance where two vehicles, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle and IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, were traveling on a seldom-used remote road to avoid detection").
