24  United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino also testified that IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle had a "dark blue or black" camper shell. As noted before, this testimony went uncorroborated by Officer Reymundo Reyes and United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides. Although campers are frequently seen by courts as tools of the smuggling trade, see (RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle that was stopped was carrying a camper shell, which are commonly used to transport undocumented aliens.); (finding that the defendant's vehicle, a vehicle with a camper shell which could easily hide several undocumented aliens, was of a type frequently used by smugglers.); Orona-Sanchez, 648 F.2d at 1041 (stating that [the agents testified . . . that alien smuggling was frequently done by the use of a pickup with a camper shell.]), the United States Department of Homeland Security gives little weight to this observation in the instant case because of the ambiguity surrounding the existence of the camper shell.
