Agent Jorge Luis Trevino further testified that, as he followed RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, "all of the five passengers in that vehicle were just sitting straight, just stiff, not looking, not communicating with each other." (Id. at 2:22 p.m.). Although United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino also stated that the passengers "all looked . . . packed in the vehicle," he acknowledged on cross examination that RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle was in fact "designed to hold that many people," with "two . . . sitting in front and three in back." (Id. at 2:24, 3:05, 3:13 p.m.). He noted that RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, too, was "going on and off the road," 10 "probably about three times, two times" over "not a very far distance," and the fact that "the vehicles went off the road . . . made him believe that the drivers were nervous because he was behind them." (Id. at 2:22 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:10, 1:16 p.m.). RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle also appeared to be "riding low," and "half of its passengers were wearing caps." 11 (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:22-2:23 p.m.). All of these observations were made as the "sun was going down" 12 and "from behind the vehicle," not from the side, because, as previously noted, the road consists of only two lanes. (Id. at 2:23-2:24, 3:08, 3:10, 3:12 p.m.).
