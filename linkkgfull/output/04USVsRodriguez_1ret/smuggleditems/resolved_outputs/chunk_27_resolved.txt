When Officer Reymundo Reyes of the Freer Police Department reported to work on the evening of February 4, 2013, he was briefed by the previous officer, who informed him that the police department had been advised of a BOLO (\"be on the lookout\") for IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle. (Id. at 3:35 p.m.). Officer Reymundo Reyes wrote the license plate number of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle on his hand at the beginning of the shift. (Id. at 3:35 p.m.). Around 8:40 p.m., an hour and a half into his shift, he \"noticed a vehicle that was passing by him\" in the same direction, traveling northbound on Highway 16. (Id. at 3:35-3:36, 3:48 p.m.). He noticed it was IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, and shortly thereafter recognized that the first three digits matched what was written on his hand. (Id. at 3:37 p.m.). He then followed IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle for \"three or four blocks\" until it stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of Highway 16 and U.S. Highway 59, where he was then able to confirm that the license plate matched the BOLO vehicle. (Id. at 3:37-3:38, 3:52-3:53 p.m.). The driver of IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR., then \"made a right turn\" at the intersection, but \"did not use a turning signal,\" so Officer Reymundo Reyes decided to conduct a traffic stop. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:38 p.m.).
