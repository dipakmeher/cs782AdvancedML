During the hearing, Defendant IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. appeared to concede the fact that the route from Laredo, Texas to Dallas, Texas would be a convenient route for smugglers to take, as evidenced by the following statements by his counsel during the cross examination of United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino: ". . . what a smuggler wants to do . . . is drive up U.S. Highway 59, make this turn onto Farm-to-Market Road 2050, and then hope you guys don't pay any attention to him. . . . And if you don't, then his chances of getting caught are very slim at that point. . . . The only way is if he just happens to run into a roving United States Border Patrol agent or gets pulled over by Officer Reymundo Reyes . . . ." (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:58-2:59 p.m.). Defendant RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s vehicle also suggested that "since you can drive down to San Pablo Road, and then drive over to Highway 16, and then drive up Highway 16, there's no reason to drop anybody off . . . ." (Id. at 2:59 p.m.). He also noted that, from Highway 16, "you can work your way over to a major highway going north." (Id. at 2:33 p.m.). "That's the reason why smugglers want to get on Highway 16, because once you get on Highway 16, you're . . . kind of home free in a way; you don't have any more checkpoints." (Id.).
