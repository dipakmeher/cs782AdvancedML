23  Although RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan was registered to Hertz Rental Car Company, Defendant IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. actually rented RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan at the Laredo International Airport. (May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Ex. 10). Defendant RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR. elicited testimony from SANTIAGO HINOJOSA, a manager with the Hertz Rental Car Company at the Laredo International Airport, that it was "not unusual" to rent a RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan from one location that is registered to another city or state. (May 2nd Hr'g at 1:46 p.m.). RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedans currently at the Laredo airport location are registered to "New York, . . . Florida, Louisiana," as their registration "depends on where the company purchased them." (Id.). In essence, a rental RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan's registration does not necessarily coincide with where the location RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan was in fact rented from. (Id. at 1:47 p.m.). Although United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino testified on cross-examination that he knew Hertz Rental Car Company has "rental car places all over," (id. at 3:32 p.m.), he was not asked whether he was aware that RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedans rented out of one location are registered to distant locations. Based on United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino's recurrent testimony that RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan was out of "Dallas, Texas," it seems logical to infer that he was proceeding under the rational impression that the rental RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan registered to Hertz Rental Car Company was in fact rented from the Dallas, Texas area.
