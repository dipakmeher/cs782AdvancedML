During the cross examination of United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino, a more detailed description of Farm-to-Market Road 2050 and its surroundings was elicited. Mills Bennett Road is a "dirt road" which, "probably about five miles, six miles, south of the Freer Immigration Checkpoint," intersects Farm-to-Market Road 2050 and travels eastward. (Id. at 2:34, 2:36 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:06 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 1, 12). The entrance and office of the aforementioned wind farm near Farm-to-Market Road 2050 is on the west side of Farm-to-Market Road 2050 "between twelve and fifteen miles" from the checkpoint on U.S. Highway 59. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:39 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 14-16). The windmills themselves extend out to the west of Farm-to-Market Road 2050 across various ranches. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:43 p.m.). San Pablo Road is south of, but "really close to, the wind farm near Farm-to-Market Road 2050," and is "another road that goes to the east off of Farm-to-Market Road 2050." (Id. at 2:41-2:42 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 17-18). Also "right around" and slightly south of the wind farm near Farm-to-Market Road 2050 is the "Moglia Ranch House", as well as the "Stag Ranch Trailer". (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:45-2:46 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g. Def. Exs. 19-20). Farther south down Farm-to-Market Road 2050 is "Santo Nino Road, also known as Dinn Ranch," which also extends to the east. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:47 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 1, 21). Both San Pablo Road and Santo Nino Road extend to Highway 16, providing vehicle access the entire way. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:51-2:52 p.m.).
