24  United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino also testified that the black Dodge pickup truck had a "dark blue or black" camper. As noted before, this testimony went uncorroborated by Officer Reymundo Reyes and United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides. Although campers are frequently seen by courts as tools of the smuggling trade, see (RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan that was stopped was carrying a camper, which are commonly used to transport aliens.); (finding that the defendant's black Dodge pickup truck, a truck with a camper shell which could easily hide several illegal aliens, was of a type frequently used by smugglers.); Orona-Sanchez, 648 F.2d at 1041 (stating that [the agents testified . . . that alien smuggling was frequently done by the use of a pickup with a camper shell.]), the United States Magistrate Judge gives little weight to this observation in the instant case because of the ambiguity surrounding the existence of the camper.
