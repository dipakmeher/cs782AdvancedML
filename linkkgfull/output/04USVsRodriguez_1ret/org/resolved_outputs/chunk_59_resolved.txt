Here,  there was a sufficient nexus between the white Malibu sedan and black Dodge pickup truck for United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides to have probable cause to arrest IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. upon  contact with him. 31 It appears that at this time that the United States Border Patrol agents were  aware that Corinth, Texas and Dallas, Texas were only \"thirty minutes\"  apart. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:30 p.m.). More significantly, United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides was aware that the last name of the registered owner of  the black Dodge pickup truck was the same as RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s, the driver of  the white Malibu sedan who had been arrested for transporting illegal  aliens. United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides therefore had sufficient evidence to  conclude that the white Malibu sedan and black Dodge pickup truck were driving in tandem, and thus had  probable cause to arrest. 32  See (noting that the United States Border Patrol agents \"rightly focused\" \"on their  knowledge of the load car-scout car pattern to conclude that the  defendant was participating in the driver of the other vehicle's  drug-smuggling activity, which gave them probable cause to arrest  him.); see  also (because    the defendant \"possessed a pager and a cellular phone,  had  been seen twice on different roads in the vicinity of Corinth, Texas and Dallas, Texas, near a vehicle containing twenty-eight aliens at a time when those roads were not  normally traveled, and both . . . vehicles had been rented from the  closely located branches of the same nonlocal rental agency,\"  concluding that probable cause to arrest was established); (considering that the \"lead car-load car\" technique, in  addition to familial relationships between the occupants of the two  vehicles, would have justified an arrest of the occupants of the  second car).
