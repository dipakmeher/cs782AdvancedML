Although IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s black Dodge pickup truck appears to contest the reasonableness of his initial traffic stop on Farm-to-Market Road 2050 for failing to use a turn signal, arguing that the traffic stop on Farm-to-Market Road 2050 was pretextual, this argument has no merit. See (stating that previous Supreme Court cases "foreclose any argument that the constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops depends on the actual motivations of the individual officers involved."); ("Although some courts have held that a lawful traffic stop may nonetheless violate the if the traffic stop was merely a pretext to allow officers to search for contraband . . . this Court has rejected that position. In Causey, we said that 'so long as police do no more than they are objectively authorized and legally permitted to do, their motives in doing so are irrelevant and hence not subject to inquiry.") (quoting; see also (Vernon 2011) ("An operator shall use the signal authorized by to indicate an intention to turn, change lanes, or start from a parked position."))
