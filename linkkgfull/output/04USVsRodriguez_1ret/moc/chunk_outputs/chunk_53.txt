Shortly thereafter Officer Reymundo Reyes's dispatch advised him that the "owner of the black Dodge pickup truck was a female," and so he asked IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. "whose black Dodge pickup truck it was, and he said it was his aunt's black Dodge pickup truck." Defendant then stated that it "belonged to his cousin" instead. Officer Reymundo Reyes therefore inquired into IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s travel plans, and he stated that he was "coming from Laredo, Texas, and he was going to Dallas, Texas," a statement which raised Officer Reymundo Reyes's suspicions because of the route from Laredo, Texas to Dallas, Texas being driven on Interstate 35. All of Officer Reymundo Reyes's questions came prior to his issuing the citation, and fall within the ambit of what is permissible under the law, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit "has consistently approved a police officer's questioning a driver's travel plans where the driver was not the authorized vehicle lessee or otherwise appeared to lack driving authority." (stating also that a police officer may also ask about the purpose and itinerary of a driver's trip during the traffic stop.) These questions "may efficiently determine whether a traffic violation has taken place, and if so, whether a citation or warning should be issued or an arrest made." Id. Here, significantly, "the questioning did nothing to extend the duration of the initial, valid seizure."
