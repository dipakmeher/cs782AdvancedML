Agent Jorge Luis Trevino further testified that, as he followed the white Malibu sedan, "all of the five passengers in that vehicle were just sitting straight, just stiff, not looking, not communicating with each other." (Id. at 2:22 p.m.). Although United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino also stated that the passengers "all looked . . . packed in the vehicle," he acknowledged on cross examination that the white Malibu sedan was in fact "designed to hold that many people," with "two . . . sitting in front and three in back." (Id. at 2:24, 3:05, 3:13 p.m.). He noted that the white Malibu sedan, too, was "going on and off Farm-to-Market Road 2050," 10 "probably about three times, two times" over "not a very far distance," and the fact that "the vehicles went off Farm-to-Market Road 2050 . . . made him believe that the drivers were nervous because he was behind them." (Id. at 2:22 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:10, 1:16 p.m.). The white Malibu sedan also appeared to be "riding low," and "half of its passengers were wearing caps." 11 (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:22-2:23 p.m.). All of these observations were made as the "sun was going down" 12 and "from behind the vehicle," not from the side, because, as previously noted, Farm-to-Market Road 2050 consists of only two lanes. (Id. at 2:23-2:24, 3:08, 3:10, 3:12 p.m.).
