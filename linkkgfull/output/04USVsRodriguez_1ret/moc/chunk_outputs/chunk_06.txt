On the evening of February 4, 2013, United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino was stationed at the Freer Immigration Checkpoint, "Echo 43," on U.S. Highway 59 outside of Freer, Texas. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:12 p.m.; see also May 2nd Hr'g, Gov't Ex. 2). On that evening, he was "assigned to checkpoint and processing," meaning that he was both "inspecting the vehicles on U.S. Highway 59 going towards . . . Corpus or Houston or Freer, Texas" and also "processing some undocumented . . . illegals . . . at the Freer Immigration Checkpoint." (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:08 p.m.). "While he was processing . . . inside the Freer Immigration Checkpoint Building, . . . the primary agent at that time," United States Border Patrol Agent Ignacio Rodriguez Jr., "called out two vehicles going southbound, a white one and a black one." (Id. at 2:09 p.m.). The two vehicles, a "white Malibu sedan" and a "black Dodge pickup truck," had exited off of U.S. Highway 59 to the right and turned southbound onto Farm-to-Market Road 2050, a road "adjacent to the Border Patrol Station Parking Lot," about "150 feet . . . 200 feet, more or less," from the Freer Immigration Checkpoint office.
