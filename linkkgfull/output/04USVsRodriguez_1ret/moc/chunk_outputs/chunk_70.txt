17  Officer Reymundo Reyes further testified that it was within his rights to impound the black Dodge pickup truck for lack of proof of insurance, and that it was a decision within an "officer's discretion." (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:44,  3:57 p.m.). He has impounded between "eight to ten" vehicles since the beginning of the year because of "no driver's license, no insurance, . . . or expired registration." should be replaced with He has impounded between "eight to ten" white Malibu sedan and black Dodge pickup trucks since the beginning of the year because of "no driver's license, no insurance, . . . or expired registration."  ( Id. at 3:58 p.m.).

However, according to the provided RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary, "Officer Reymundo Reyes" should be replaced with "Officer Reymundo Reyes", "black Dodge pickup truck" should be replaced with "black Dodge pickup truck", and no other replacements are needed in this text chunk. The original instruction to replace "vehicles" with "white Malibu sedan and black Dodge pickup trucks" was an error on my part because it was not based on the provided RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary.
