Although United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides did not recall having any conversation en route to the Border Patrol station, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. testified that, on the way to the Border Patrol station, United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides "was asking him a lot of questions," using "bad language" and "bad words" and talking "very rude." (May 3rd Hr'g at 2:44, 3:27-3:28 p.m.). According to the defendant, United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides informed him that he was "screwed big time . . . and that the guys in RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan already said everything about him, and he better start talking, and if not, he was going to jail." (Id. at 3:28 p.m.). IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. then testified that he did not know why United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides was asking him to go the Border Patrol station; that "he didn't know what was going on or anything;" that he did not know who was in RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan; that he "did not know how many RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedans there were;" that he "did not know whose RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan it was . . . I mean, there's plenty of RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedans and the black Dodge pickup trucks, all different colors;" and that he "did not know if they were talking about the same vehicle or not," because United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides "didn't specify." (Id. at 3:37-3:38 p.m.). IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. also retracted the statement he had given on the stand ten minutes previously that "the guys in RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan already said everything about him" and "screwed him big time," testifying instead that United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides said only "that they had a RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan," to which the defendant responded, "well I don't know what you're talking about." (Id. at 3:37 p.m.). Moments after that, IGNACIO RODRIGUEZ, JR. appeared to again change his testimony, stating that United States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides "said all these bad words to him," but had said nothing about a RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan. (Id. at 3:38-3:39 p.m.).
