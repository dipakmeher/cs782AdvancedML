Lastly, the number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers of RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan also factors into the reasonable suspicion analysis. During the hearing, United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino explained that "all of the five passengers in that RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan were just sitting straight, just stiff, not looking, not communicating with each other." Although RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan had five visible passengers, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan was in fact "designed to hold that many people." Additionally, as mentioned before, all of United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino's observations of the passengers were made from the rear of RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan, because of the nature of the roadway. Any determination as to whether the passengers in RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, JR.'s white Malibu sedan are conversing or not, based on the vantage point United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino had, seems tenuous at best, and thus no weight is afforded this observation. United States Border Patrol Agent Jorge Luis Trevino also noted that "half of the passengers were wearing caps." However, "a factual condition that is consistent with alien smuggling does not provide reasonable suspicion if that condition also occurs even more frequently in the law-abiding public." This observation, too, adds nothing to the reasonable suspicion for the stop. Therefore, the eighth Brignoni-Ponce factor does nothing to favor the reasonableness of the roving United States Border Patrol stop. Nonetheless, "under a totality of the circumstances analysis, the absence of a particular factor will not control a Court's conclusions."
