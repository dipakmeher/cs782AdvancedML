Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa has not provided any evidence that an early disposition, or "fast track," program was available to him in the Laredo, Texas, or that he could have received any benefit from the program. Accordingly, his counsel was not deficient for failing to ask for that benefit, nor is there any prejudice to Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa as a result of such failure. ("An attorney's failure to raise a meritless argument ... cannot form the basis of a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the result of the proceeding would not have been different had the attorney raised the issue.")

To the extent that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa claims that counsel was constitutionally ineffective by failing to argue that the United States District Court should exercise its discretion to impose a sentence that would minimize the sentencing disparity created by fast track programs in some sentencing jurisdictions but not others, a United States District Court is not required "to factor in, when sentencing a defendant, the sentencing disparity caused by early disposition programs" to prevent a sentence from being unreasonable." In addition, any sentencing disparity resulting from fast track disposition programs is not unwarranted as the disparity was also intended by Congress. See. Again, counsel's performance was not constitutionally deficient for failing to raise a meritless claim. See.
