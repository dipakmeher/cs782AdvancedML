In his penultimate argument, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to "either (1) request a motion from the United States for a 'fast track' downward departure as part of his plea agreement, or (2) request a downward departure from the United States District Court at sentencing as the 'fast track' program was no longer available in Laredo, Texas." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground Four); (D.E. 35, p. 22-28).

Finally, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa claims that counsel was constitutionally ineffective by failing to investigate Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's "claim that he was in fact a United States citizen and therefore was factually innocent of Illegal Re-entry." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground Six); (D.E. 35 p.28-40).
