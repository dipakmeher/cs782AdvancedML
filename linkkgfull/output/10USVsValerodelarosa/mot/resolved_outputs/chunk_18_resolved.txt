Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's statements under oath are entitled to a strong presumption of truthfulness. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit affords "great weight to the defendant's statements at the plea colloquy." The record contradicts Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's claim that he did not understand his rights and the charges against him. Additionally, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's waiver of his right to file a motion pursuant to  was knowing and voluntary.

Because Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's challenge to the validity of his plea agreement fails, the United States District Court can find that the Plea Agreement and his waiver of rights contained therein are valid and enforceable. See. As noted, it is clear from the rearraignment that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa understood that he was waiving his right both to appeal (except under certain circumstances) and to file any motion which is all that is required for his waiver to be enforceable. See (waiver is knowing if defendant understood he had a right, and understood he was giving it up). The claim in Ground One is dismissed as barred by his knowing waiver, contradicted by the record and otherwise insufficient to show that counsel's recommendation that he enter into the plea agreement was "below an objective standard of reasonableness."
