In light of these facts, counsel's failure to object to the single recency point which did not affect the advisory guideline range does not demonstrate prejudice and fails as the basis for an constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The claim in Ground Three is dismissed as without merit.

The alleged error by counsel in Ground Four is not an attack on the validity of the waiver or the plea, and is, therefore waived and should be dismissed on the basis of the waiver. In addition, it is wholly without merit.

The so-called "fast track" programs allow certain defendants to plead guilty and to waive certain rights very early in the criminal process, in exchange for a motion by the United States for downward departure pursuant to. provides: "Upon motion by the United States, the court may depart downward not more than 4 levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the United States Attorney General and the United States Attorney for the district in which the United States District Court resides." Thus, the "fast track" program, initially established in the United States District Court along the southwestern border of the United States in order to accommodate the large number of immigration cases, authorizes the prosecution to offer defendants some form of sentence reduction in exchange for the waiver of certain procedural rights. See United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, where such programs were initially implemented near the Rio Grande, and where courts like the Laredo, Texas division operate, allowing for efficient handling of cases under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, including considerations under Amendment 740 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines and Amendment 742 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit.
