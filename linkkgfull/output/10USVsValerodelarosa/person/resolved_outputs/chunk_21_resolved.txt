The Kazen was made aware by both counsel and Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa, as well as the PSR, of Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's family situation and of his membership in a gang, periods of incarceration, violation of the laws of the United States by returning illegally after deportation and violating supervised release by committing additional offenses, using drugs, failure to report as directed, failure to participate in drug treatment. See PSR    …  24-26., 31-34. It would have been frivolous to argue that a defendant who had repeatedly illegally returned to the United States after deportation, who had engaged in alien smuggling, who had used aliases, who listed no substantial assets or liabilities on his financial statement was "culturally assimilated" to a degree warranting a downward departure or variance from the indisputably correctly determined guideline range.

Even if counsel had argued more extensively for a downward variance or departure based on Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's unexceptional family situation and on his "reasons" for knowingly breaking the law by returning illegally after every deportation, the Fifth Circuit has held that a court may consider a defendant's cultural assimilation, but is not required to give it dispositive weight. Had counsel raised this issue, it would not have received favorable consideration in light of the factors outlined above. Thus, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa cannot establish that his counsel was constitutionally deficient on this ground.
