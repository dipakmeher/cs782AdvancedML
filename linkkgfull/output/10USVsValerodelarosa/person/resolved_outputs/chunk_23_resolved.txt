The alleged error by counsel in Ground Three is not an attack on the validity of the waiver or the plea, and is, therefore waived and should be dismissed on the basis of the waiver. In addition, the 2009 edition of the Guidelines Manual was used. See PSR § 12. Obviously, the 2009 edition included the recency point and did not consider the amendment which was not effective until November 1, 2010. More importantly, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa cannot show prejudice. Even if the one additional point for recency had been subtracted from his criminal history computation, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa would still have 10 criminal history points, and would remain in Category V. His advisory guidelines range would be unchanged. Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's argument that Kazen might have given him fewer months of imprisonment if he'd had only 10 criminal history points is purely speculative (not to mention unfounded) and cannot serve to satisfy the prejudice prong of. The calculation of a criminal history score and the issue whether the defendant's criminal history is under-represented are not commensurate inquiries. In providing for departures under, the Sentencing Commission recognized that a defendant's "criminal history score is unlikely to take into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history that may occur."
