Valero  has failed to make a credible showing of deficient performance on  the part of his counsel in the face of contradictory written  evidence in the record, including his express acknowledgment that    he  is satisfied that his attorney had rendered effective assistance,  and that he understands the rights that he had, all as set forth in  paragraph 13 of the Plea Agreement. Valero's belated conclusory  assertions on this point are insufficient to invalidate the knowing  and voluntary plea which included his express acknowledgment that he  "understands and agrees that each and all waivers contained in  the Agreement are made in exchange for the concessions made by the  United States in this plea agreement." (D.E. 15, p. 4 (¶9)).  Those concessions, in paragraph 10 of the plea agreement, obligated  the United States to do what it was otherwise not obligated to do,  that is, not to oppose a downward adjustment of 3 levels for timely  acceptance of responsibility.

Valero's  statements under oath are entitled to a strong presumption of  truthfulness. .  Indeed, the Fifth Circuit affords "great weight to the  defendant's statements at the plea colloquy." .  The record contradicts Valero's claim that he did not understand his  rights and the charges against him. Additionally, Valero's waiver of  his right to file a motion pursuant to     was  knowing and voluntary.
