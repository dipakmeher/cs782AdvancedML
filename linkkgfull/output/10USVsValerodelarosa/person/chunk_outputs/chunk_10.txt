In  his penultimate argument, Valero claims that his counsel was  ineffective for failing to "either (1) request a motion from  the Government for a 'fast track' downward departure as part of his  plea agreement, or (2) request a downward departure from the court  at sentencing as the 'fast track' program was no longer available in  Laredo." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground Four); (D.E. 35, p.  22-28).

Finally,  Valero claims that counsel was constitutionally ineffective by  failing to investigate Valero's "claim that he was in fact a  United States citizen and therefore was factually innocent of  Illegal Re-entry." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground Six); (D.E.  35 p.28-40).
