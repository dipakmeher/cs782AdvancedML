While  incarcerated for his previous felony, defense counsel assisted the  defendant with his application for derivative citizenship with the  Department of Homeland Security/citizenship and Immigration Services  in San  Antonio ,  Texas. During the application process, his paternal grandmother  submitted a petition for an alien relative wherein she described  that the defendant's father intermittently resided in Nuevo Laredo,  Tamaulipas, Mexico and Texas during his childhood. Immigration  authorities subsequently denied the application based on the fact  that the defendant failed to prove that his father was physically  present in the United States from the age of 16 through 20 (1978 to  1982) which failed to meet the criteria of him being present for ten  years, five after the age of 14, and prior to the defendant's birth.
