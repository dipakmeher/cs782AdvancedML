In  short, none of Valero's arguments compel the conclusion that his  plea or the appeal waiver was unknowing or involuntary. The record  reveals that he understood the nature of the charges, was admonished  as to the constitutional rights he was waiving, and was advised of  the potential sentences he faced.    In  addition, he confirmed under oath that he was entering a knowing and  voluntary plea that was not the result of threats or coercion. Every  time Valero was asked if he understood the court's admonishments, he  answered affirmatively. "Solemn declarations in open court  carry a strong presumption of verity." ("The subsequent presentation of conclusory allegations  unsupported by specifics is subject to summary dismissal, as are  contentions that in the face of the record are wholly incredible."); (holding that the defendant's "statements that his plea was  knowing and voluntary and that he understood the rights he was  waiving create a presumption that in fact the plea is valid"). See  also (finding no error in district court's refusal to hold an evidentiary  hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel claim where, at  rearraignment, the judge reiterated much of what was set forth in  the plea agreement, which the defendant represented to the court  that she read and understood).
