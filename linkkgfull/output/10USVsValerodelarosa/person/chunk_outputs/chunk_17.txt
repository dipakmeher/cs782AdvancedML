Because  Valero's challenge to the validity of his plea agreement fails, the  Court can find that the Plea Agreement and his waiver of rights contained therein are valid and enforceable. See .  As noted, it is clear from the rearraignment that Valero understood  that he was waiving his right both to appeal (except under certain  circumstances) and to file any motion which is all that is required for his waiver to be  enforceable. See (waiver is knowing if defendant understood he had a right, and  understood he was giving it up). The claim in Ground One is  dismissed as barred by his knowing waiver, contradicted by the  record and otherwise insufficient to show that counsel's  recommendation that he enter into the plea agreement was "below  an objective standard of reasonableness."
