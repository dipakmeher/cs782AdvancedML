Valero  first alleges that counsel was constitutionally ineffective because  he "recommended that Valero sign a plea agreement which  contained waivers of appeal and provided zero benefit to Valero  which Valero could have attained via a 'straight up' plea."  (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground One); (D.E. 35, p. 9-16).

Valero  next alleges that counsel was constitutionally ineffective for the  alleged failure to recognize the "request a downward departure  based upon amendment 740 for cultural assimilation of the United  States Sentencing Guidelines which became active four months prior  to his client's sentencing." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground  Two); (D.E. 35 p. 16-19).

Valero's  third argument is that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective  by failing to recognize that the single recency point added to  Valero's criminal history score was incorrect due to the elimination  of recency points by Amendment 742, effective    November  1, 2010. (D.E. 87, § 2255 Motion, Ground Three); (D.E. 89 p.  20-22).
