Initially,  Valero claims in his "Affidavit" that he never discussed  it, did not know it contained a waiver of rights, and did not know  that he did not have to sign the Plea Agreement. (D.E. 35, p. 9-10).  These claims are directly contradicted by Valero's own statement in  his Plea Agreement Addendum, (D.E. 16, p. 2), his signing the Plea  Agreement (D.E. 15, p. 9), and by the Magistrate Judge's finding  that Valero "fully understands the nature of the charges and  penalties" and "understands his Constitutional and  statutory rights and wishes to waive these rights," and that  his "plea is made freely and voluntarily." (D.E. 18, p.  2).
