At  sentencing, the Court asked Valero directly whether he had seen the  PSR and whether he had any objections to it. (D.E. 40, p. 2). Valero  stated that he had seen it and had no objections. ( Id .,  p. 3). Counsel argued the circumstances on the case in support of  the downward departure motion. ( Id. ,  p. 3-6). Valero then spoke on his own behalf. ( Id. p. 6).

The  Court said that the criminal history was appropriately calculated  and does not warrant a departure. At an offense level 21, criminal  history category V, the advisory guideline range found by the Court  is 70 to 87 months, with an additional 8 months for the revocation  of supervised release, to be served consecutively. ( Id. ,  p. 7-8). The Court sentenced Valero to serve 82 months of  imprisonment consecutive to 8 months of imprisonment for his    violation  of supervised release, for a total term of imprisonment of 90 months  in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (D.E. 29, p. 3). When asked  Valero expressly stated that he had no "questions or objections  regarding that sentence." (D.E. 40, p. 9).
