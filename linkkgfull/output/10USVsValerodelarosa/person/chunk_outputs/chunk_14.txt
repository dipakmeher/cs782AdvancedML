Valero  knew the potential punishment he faced. He also knew his plea was  knowing and voluntary. Valero's testimony was abundantly clear that  his decision to plead guilty was voluntary and that no one had  forced or coerced him to plead guilty. (D.E. 69, p. 17).

Under  the terms of the plea agreement, Valero should be held to the  bargain to which he agreed. He  knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to file a motion .  Accordingly, Valero's motion fails, in its entirety, because he specifically waived the  right to file such a motion.

The  record supports the conclusion that:

(1)  the plea agreement and the waiver contained therein were knowing and  voluntary;

(2)  the    waiver  provision in the plea agreement is enforceable and supports the  government's motion for summary judgment; and,

(3)  the waiver and the record in this case preclude Valero from  asserting all of the grounds in his current motion.

D.  An Alternative Basis for Denying Relief

Each  of the claims raised by Valero will be separately addressed. None of  them warrant relief.
