Accordingly, because Petitioner expressly admitted in the Plea Agreement that he was not a United States citizen, and because there is no indication that the Plea Agreement was not knowingly and voluntarily entered into, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa failed to show that his counsel, who was made aware of all of these facts in the PSR, was constitutionally ineffective for failing to investigate further and argue that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa was a United States citizen. Counsel's conduct in the face of Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's repeated admissions and acknowledgment of his alienage cannot be shown to have fallen "below an objective standard of reasonableness." See .

Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa has failed to rebut the presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. He has failed to show that both deficiency and prejudice resulted from counsel's alleged errors in any of his allegations. The motion should be dismissed with prejudice as barred by his valid waiver of collateral attack in his Plea Agreement and, alternatively, without merit.

The motion and the record of this case conclusively show that no relief is warranted. Consequently, there is no need for an evidentiary hearing.

IT IS ORDERED that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's motion be, and the same hereby is, DENIED.
