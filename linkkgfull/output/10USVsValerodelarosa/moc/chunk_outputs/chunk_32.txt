While incarcerated for his previous felony, defense counsel assisted Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa with his application for derivative citizenship with the Department of Homeland Security/United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in Laredo, Texas. During the application process, his paternal grandmother submitted a petition for an alien relative wherein she described that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's father intermittently resided in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas and Texas during his childhood. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) subsequently denied the application based on the fact that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa failed to prove that his father was physically present in the United States from the age of 16 through 20 (1978 to 1982) which failed to meet the criteria of him being present for ten years, five after the age of 14, and prior to Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's birth.
