The so-called "fast track" programs allow certain defendants to plead guilty and to waive certain rights very early in the criminal process, in exchange for a motion by the United States Department of Justice for downward departure pursuant to. provides: "Upon motion by the United States Department of Justice, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas may depart downward not more than 4 levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the United States Attorney General and the United States Department of Justice in which the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas resides." Thus, the "fast track" program, initially established in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas along the southwestern border of the United States in order to accommodate the large number of immigration cases, authorizes the prosecution to offer defendants some form of sentence reduction in exchange for the waiver of certain procedural rights. See United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, where such programs were initially implemented near the Rio Grande, and where courts like the Laredo, Texas division operate, allowing for efficient handling of cases under the United States Sentencing Commission, including considerations under United States Sentencing Commission and United States Sentencing Commission, as interpreted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
