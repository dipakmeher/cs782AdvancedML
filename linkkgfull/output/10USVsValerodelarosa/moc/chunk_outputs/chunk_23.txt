Even if counsel had argued more extensively for a downward variance or departure based on Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's unexceptional family situation and on his "reasons" for knowingly breaking the law by returning illegally after every deportation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that a court may consider a defendant's cultural assimilation, but is not required to give it dispositive weight. Had counsel raised this issue, it would not have received favorable consideration in light of the factors outlined above. Thus, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa cannot establish that his counsel was constitutionally deficient on this ground.
