The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas was made aware by both counsel and Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa, as well as the record, of Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's family situation and of his membership in a gang, periods of incarceration, violation of the laws of the United States by returning illegally after deportation and violating supervised release by committing additional offenses, using drugs, failure to report as directed, failure to participate in drug treatment. See the record    …  24-26., 31-34. It would have been frivolous to argue that a defendant who had repeatedly illegally returned to the United States after deportation, who had engaged in alien smuggling, who had used aliases, who listed no substantial assets or liabilities on his financial statement was "culturally assimilated" to a degree warranting a downward departure or variance from the indisputably correctly determined guideline range.
