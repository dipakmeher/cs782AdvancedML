Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa has failed to make a credible showing of deficient performance on the part of his counsel in the face of contradictory written evidence in the record, including his express acknowledgment that he is satisfied that his attorney had rendered effective assistance, and that he understands the rights that he had, all as set forth in paragraph 13 of the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States. Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's belated conclusory assertions on this point are insufficient to invalidate the knowing and voluntary plea which included his express acknowledgment that he "understands and agrees that each and all waivers contained in the Agreement are made in exchange for the concessions made by the United States in this plea agreement." (D.E. 15, p. 4 (¶9)). Those concessions, in paragraph 10 of the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States, obligated the United States to do what it was otherwise not obligated to do, that is, not to oppose a downward adjustment of 3 levels for timely acceptance of responsibility.
