Even if Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel had argued more extensively for a Request for reduced sentence based on mitigating circumstances based on Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's unexceptional Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's family situation and on his "reasons" for knowingly breaking the law by returning illegally after every deportation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that a court may consider a defendant's cultural assimilation, but is not required to give it dispositive weight. Had Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel raised this issue, it would not have received favorable consideration in light of the factors outlined above. Thus, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa cannot establish that his Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel was constitutionally deficient on this ground.
