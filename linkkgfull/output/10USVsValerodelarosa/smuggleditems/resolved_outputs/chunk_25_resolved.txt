Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa has failed to show deficient performance by Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel. His allegations are belied by the record that shows a knowing and voluntary Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States. He has failed to rebut the presumption that the statements he made under oath during the Rearraignment of Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa were true. The initial claims made by Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa are dismissed.

The second argument made by Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa is that his counsel, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel, should have requested the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas to apply United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines Manual Amendment 740 to the United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines Manual, which authorizes a downward departure on the basis of cultural assimilation. United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines Manual Amendment 742 also took effect on November 1, 2010.

However, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's claim that counsel, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel, rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance due to his alleged failure to request a downward departure or variance based on cultural assimilation or family circumstances, specifically Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's family situation, is both contradicted by the record and without merit. The record reflects that the undisputed facts of the case do not merit consideration for a guideline departure for cultural assimilation.

In determining whether a counsel's conduct is deficient, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has cautioned that attorneys should not be subjected to unrealistic standards and that, when reviewing a motion, such as Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's motion to claim ineffective assistance of counsel, the court must consider the record as a whole, including the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States and the Report and Recommendation to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.
