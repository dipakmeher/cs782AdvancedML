In light of these facts, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel's failure to object to the single recency point which did not affect the advisory guideline range does not demonstrate prejudice and fails as the basis for a constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The claim in Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's third argument is dismissed as without merit.

The alleged error by Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel in Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's penultimate argument is not an attack on the validity of the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States or the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States, and is, therefore waived and should be dismissed on the basis of the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States. In addition, it is wholly without merit.
