Initially, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa claims in his Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's Affidavit that he never discussed it, did not know it contained a waiver of rights, and did not know that he did not have to sign the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States. (D.E. 35, p. 9-10). These claims are directly contradicted by Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's own statement in his Plea Agreement Addendum, (D.E. 16, p. 2), his signing the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States (D.E. 15, p. 9), and by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas's finding that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa "fully understands the nature of the charges and penalties" and "understands his Constitutional and statutory rights and wishes to waive these rights," and that his "plea is made freely and voluntarily." (D.E. 18, p. 2).
