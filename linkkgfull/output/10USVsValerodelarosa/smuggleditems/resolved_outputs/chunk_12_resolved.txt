Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa first alleges that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he "recommended that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa sign the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States which contained waivers of appeal and provided zero benefit to Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa which Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa could have attained via a 'straight up' plea." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground One); (D.E. 35, p. 9-16).

Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa next alleges that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel was constitutionally ineffective for the alleged failure to recognize the "request a downward departure based upon United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines Manual Amendment 740 for cultural assimilation of the United States Sentencing Commission which became active four months prior to his client's sentencing." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground Two); (D.E. 35 p. 16-19).
