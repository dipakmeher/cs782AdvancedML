The alleged error by Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel in Ground Three is not an attack on the validity of the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States or the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States, and is, therefore waived and should be dismissed on the basis of the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States. In addition, the 2009 edition of the United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines Manual was used. See the United States Probation Office. Obviously, the 2009 edition included the recency point and did not consider United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines Manual Amendment 742 which was not effective until November 1, 2010. More importantly, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa cannot show prejudice. Even if the one additional point for recency had been subtracted from his criminal history computation, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa would still have 10 criminal history points, and would remain in Category V. His advisory United States Sentencing Commission range would be unchanged. Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's argument that the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas might have given him fewer months of imprisonment if he'd had only 10 criminal history points is purely speculative (not to mention unfounded) and cannot serve to satisfy the prejudice prong of. The calculation of a criminal history score and the issue whether the defendant's criminal history is under-represented are not commensurate inquiries. In providing for departures under, the United States Sentencing Commission recognized that a defendant's "criminal history score is unlikely to take into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history that may occur."
