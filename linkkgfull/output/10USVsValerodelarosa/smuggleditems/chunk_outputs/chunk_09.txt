Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel filed objections in support of Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's motion to claim ineffective assistance of counsel for a criminal history score that over-represents the seriousness of Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's criminal history because he received two criminal history points for a prior conviction at the age of 18, over 9 years earlier, and three criminal history points for a conviction at the age of 19, which occurred over 8 years earlier. The United States Probation Office responded.

The United States Probation Office does not agree. The criminal history points have been correctly calculated and all applicable guidelines have been applied, pursuant to the United States Sentencing Commission. The offense committed by Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa at the age of 18 was for aiding and abetting the illegal reentry of undocumented aliens where he received three years' probation, which was revoked and sentenced to 3 months' imprisonment. The conviction at the age of 19 was for transportation of a certain undocumented alien within the United States by means of a motor vehicle for private financial gain, in which he was sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment, and eventually revoked to 6 months' confinement. Although these arrests occurred over 8 years ago, they demonstrate a pattern of Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa violating the immigration laws of the United States.
