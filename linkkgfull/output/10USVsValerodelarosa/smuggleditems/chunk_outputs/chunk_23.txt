Because Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's challenge to the validity of the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States fails, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas can find that the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States and his waiver of rights contained therein are valid and enforceable. See. As noted, it is clear from the rearraignment that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa understood that he was waiving his right both to appeal (except under certain circumstances) and to file any motion which is all that is required for his waiver to be enforceable. See (waiver is knowing if defendant understood he had a right, and understood he was giving it up). The claim in Ground One is dismissed as barred by his knowing waiver, contradicted by the record and otherwise insufficient to show that counsel's recommendation that he enter into the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States was "below an objective standard of reasonableness."
