Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa first alleges that counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he "recommended that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa sign the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States which contained waivers of appeal and provided zero benefit to Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa which Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa could have attained via a 'straight up' plea." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground One); (D.E. 35, p. 9-16).

Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa next alleges that counsel was constitutionally ineffective for the alleged failure to recognize the "request a downward departure based upon Amendment 740 of the United States Sentencing Commission for cultural assimilation of the United States Sentencing Commission which became active four months prior to his client's sentencing." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground Two); (D.E. 35 p. 16-19).
