In light of these facts, counsel's failure to object to the single recency point which did not affect the advisory guideline range does not demonstrate prejudice and fails as the basis for a constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The claim in Ground Three is dismissed as without merit.

The alleged error by counsel in Ground Four is not an attack on the validity of the waiver or the plea, and is, therefore waived and should be dismissed on the basis of the waiver. In addition, it is wholly without merit.
