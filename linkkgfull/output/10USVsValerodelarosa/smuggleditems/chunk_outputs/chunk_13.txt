Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's third argument is that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective by failing to recognize that the single recency point added to Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's criminal history score was incorrect due to the elimination of recency points by Amendment 742 of the United States Sentencing Commission, effective November 1, 2010. (D.E. 87, § 2255 Motion, Ground Three); (D.E. 89 p. 20-22).

In his penultimate argument, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to "either (1) request a motion from the United States Department of Justice for a 'fast track' downward departure as part of the Plea Agreement between Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa and the United States, or (2) request a downward departure from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas at sentencing as the 'fast track' program was no longer available in Laredo, Texas." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground Four); (D.E. 35, p. 22-28).
