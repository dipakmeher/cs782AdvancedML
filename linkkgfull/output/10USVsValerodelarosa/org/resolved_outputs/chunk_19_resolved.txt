In short, none of Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's arguments compel the conclusion that his plea or the appeal waiver was unknowing or involuntary. The record reveals that he understood the nature of the charges, was admonished as to the constitutional rights he was waiving, and was advised of the potential sentences he faced. In addition, he confirmed under oath that he was entering a knowing and voluntary plea that was not the result of threats or coercion. Every time Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa was asked if he understood the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas's admonishments, he answered affirmatively. "Solemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity." ("The subsequent presentation of conclusory allegations unsupported by specifics is subject to summary dismissal, as are contentions that in the face of the record are wholly incredible."); (holding that the defendant's "statements that his plea was knowing and voluntary and that he understood the rights he was waiving create a presumption that in fact the plea is valid").
