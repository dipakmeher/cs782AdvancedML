Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa next alleges that counsel was constitutionally ineffective for the alleged failure to recognize the "request a downward departure based upon Amendment 740 of the United States Sentencing Commission for cultural assimilation of the United States Sentencing Commission which became active four months prior to his client's sentencing." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground Two); (D.E. 35 p. 16-19).

Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's third argument is that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective by failing to recognize that the single recency point added to Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's criminal history score was incorrect due to the elimination of recency points by Amendment 742 of the United States Sentencing Commission, effective November 1, 2010. (D.E. 87, § 2255 Motion, Ground Three); (D.E. 89 p. 20-22).
