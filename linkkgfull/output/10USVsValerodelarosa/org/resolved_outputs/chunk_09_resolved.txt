The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas said that the criminal history was appropriately calculated and does not warrant a departure. At an offense level 21, criminal history category V, the advisory guideline range found by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas is 70 to 87 months, with an additional 8 months for the revocation of supervised release, to be served consecutively. (Id., p. 7-8). The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas sentenced Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa to serve 82 months of imprisonment consecutive to 8 months of imprisonment for his violation of supervised release, for a total term of imprisonment of 90 months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (D.E. 29, p. 3). When asked Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa expressly stated that he had no "questions or objections regarding that sentence." (D.E. 40, p. 9).

4. Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's Instant Claims

Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa first alleges that counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he "recommended that Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa sign a Plea Agreement which contained waivers of appeal and provided zero benefit to Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa which Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa could have attained via a 'straight up' plea." (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground One); (D.E. 35, p. 9-16).
