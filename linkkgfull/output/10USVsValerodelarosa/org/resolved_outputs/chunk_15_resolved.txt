Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa knew the potential punishment he faced. He also knew his plea was knowing and voluntary. Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's testimony was abundantly clear that his decision to plead guilty was voluntary and that no one had forced or coerced him to plead guilty. (D.E. 69, p. 17).

Under the terms of the Plea Agreement, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa should be held to the bargain to which he agreed. He knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to file a motion. Accordingly, Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's motion fails, in its entirety, because he specifically waived the right to file such a motion.

The record supports the conclusion that:

(1) the Plea Agreement and the waiver contained therein were knowing and voluntary;

(2) the waiver provision in the Plea Agreement is enforceable and supports the United States' motion for summary judgment; and,

(3) the waiver and the record in this case preclude Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa from asserting all of the grounds in his current motion.
