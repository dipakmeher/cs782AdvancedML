On June 8, 2010, Senior United States District Judge Kazen entered an Order stating, inter alia, "Noting no opposition by Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa to the Report and Recommendation, Kazen ORDERS that the Report and Recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge be and is hereby adopted." (D.E. 19).

3. The Sentence.

Prior to sentencing, the probation office prepared a presentence report ("PSR") which calculated the advisory Guideline imprisonment range based on a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of V to be 70 to 87 months, and the statutory maximum term of imprisonment to be 20 years, pursuant to. (PSR ·· 48, 49).

Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's counsel filed objections in support of a motion for downward departure for a criminal history score that over-represents the seriousness of Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa's criminal history because he received two criminal history points for a prior conviction at the age of 18, over 9 years earlier, and three criminal history points for a conviction at the age of 19, which occurred over 8 years earlier. The probation office responded.
