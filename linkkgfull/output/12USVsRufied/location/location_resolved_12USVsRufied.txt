Bruce Henderson reiterated that the primary agent on the scene informed Bruce Henderson that Yusif Ahmed Rufied was in the passenger seat of the truck.

II. Analysis

Preliminary examination hearings afford magistrates an opportunity to determine whether there is probable cause to detain a defendant. I Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim.3d § 86 (R 5.1). There is a two-part test to determine whether probable cause exists: belief that an offense has been committed; and belief that the defendant committed it. See. The probable cause threshold is low. A magistrate may find probable cause if the government shows "evidence sufficient to cause a person of ordinary prudence and caution to conscientiously entertain a reasonable belief of the accused's guilt." 1 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim.3d § 86 n.3 ( ) (internal quotations and citations omitted).

Additionally, according to, "the finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part." (emphasis added). Based on the testimony, the government has met its burden. The government presented evidence that an offense was committed by showing that sixty (60) undocumented aliens were found in a tractor trailer Yusif Ahmed Rufied was riding in. The government presented testimony from Bruce Henderson showing that a person of ordinary prudence and caution could conscientiously entertain a reasonable belief of the accused's guilt; specifically, that Yusif Ahmed Rufied was riding in the passenger seat of the tractor trailer and Yusif Ahmed Rufied helped load undocumented aliens into the trailer.
