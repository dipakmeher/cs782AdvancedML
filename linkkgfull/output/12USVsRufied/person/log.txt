You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

Agent Henderson stated  that Agent Silva received a duty call from Border Patrol Agent  Flores stating that sixty (60) undocumented aliens were found in a  tractor trailer. Agent Henderson testified that he arrived at the  checkpoint with Agent Silva at approximately 10:45 a.m. Agent  Henderson stated that when he arrived at the checkpoint he saw the  tractor trailer and was introduced to some of the undocumented  aliens found in the trailer. Agent Henderson stated that there were  fifty-nine (59) aliens present at the checkpoint and one (1) alien  in the hospital due to taking an improper medication. Agent  Henderson testified that Border Patrol Agents advised him that the  tractor trailer arrived at the check point at approximately 6:45  a.m. and during a secondary inspection sixty (60) aliens were found  in the rear of the trailer."

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

Agent Henderson  also reiterated that Defendant stated that Codefendant spoke with a  lady by the name of Claudia and that Defendant stated that he slept  in the truck. Agent Henderson testified that one material witness  identified Codefendant as the driver and the person that was present  at the rear of the trailer while the trailer was being loaded with  aliens. However, Agent Henderson also stated that the other material  witnesses identified a person with black skin color as the person  loading the trailer. Agent Henderson testified that there were no  justifiable facts that the $ 1700 found in Defendant's possession  was from this incident.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type PERSON. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical person names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved person. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given the following inputs:
- A list of resolved entities and their associated auxiliary descriptions  
- A text chunk  
- A list of identified entities (e.g., noun phrases, proper nouns) within that chunk  

Follow this step-by-step process for each identified entity:

Step 1: Attempt to Link to an Existing Entity  
- If the entity clearly refers to the same individual as one of the resolved entities, link it by assigning the corresponding canonical name. If the entity is a plural phrase, do not attempt to link it in Step 1; instead, handle it according to the plural noun phrase rule in Step 4.

Step 2: Create a Singleton (Only if a Proper Noun)  
- If the entity cannot be linked to any resolved entity, and it is a PROPER_NOUN, create a new entity entry for it.
- Treat it as a unique person mentioned in the text, and use the name itself as the canonical reference.

Step 3: Mark as null (Unresolvable or Non-person)  
- If the entity does not match any resolved entity and is not a PROPER_NOUN, or if it is too vague to resolve confidently, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural noun phrases such as "the occupants," "the passengers," "the defendants," "the agents," or similar:
  - If the text clearly lists all individuals represented by the phrase, link the alias to a single string combining the canonical names.
    - For two names: "Name A and Name B"
    - For three or more names: "Name A, Name B, and Name C"
  - If the text does not explicitly list all individuals represented by the plural phrase, map the alias to null.
- Never collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated in the text.

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK. Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess. Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

---
Additioal Rules: 
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES is a dictionary where each key is an alias (such as a noun phrase, or short title like “the defendant”, “the agent”, or “De Arcos”) and each value is the canonical full name of the person it refers to (e.g., “Nicole Shermaine Martinez”).

-If a person’s full name appears in the text (e.g., “Juan Carlos De Arcos”), always use the full name as the canonical reference in RESOLVED_ENTITIES — even if other mentions use shortened or role-based references (e.g., “De Arcos”, “Agent De Arcos”, “the agent”).

- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

- When resolving plural noun phrases, always follow Step 4. Do not collapse plural phrases to a single individual unless explicitly stated.

There is a two-part test to  determine whether probable cause exists: belief that an offense has  been committed; and belief that the defendant committed it. See  .  The probable cause threshold is low. A magistrate may find probable  cause if the government shows \"evidence sufficient to cause a  person of ordinary prudence and caution to conscientiously entertain  a reasonable belief of the accused's guilt.\" 1 Fed.

Crim.3d \u00a7 86 n.3 ( )  (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\nAdditionally,  according to ,  \"the finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay  evidence in  whole or in part .\"  (emphasis added). Based on the testimony, the government has met its  burden. The government presented evidence that an offense was  committed by showing that sixty (60) undocumented aliens were found  in a tractor trailer Defendant was riding in. The government    presented testimony from Agent Henderson showing that a person of  ordinary prudence and caution could conscientiously entertain a  reasonable belief of the accused's guilt; specifically, that  Defendant was riding in the passenger seat of the tractor trailer  and Defendant helped load undocumented aliens into the trailer."
