it shall set aside the sentence and remand the case for further sentencing proceedings with such instructions as the court considers appropriate.

Under these provisions, the characterization of the alleged sentencing error is critical. A sentence imposed 'outside the range of the applicable sentencing guideline' will be reversed only if it is unreasonable.

Findings of fact that underlie the district court's sentence are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.
