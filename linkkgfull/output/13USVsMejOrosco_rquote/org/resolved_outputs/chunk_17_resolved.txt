A more exacting approach to appellate review of sentences would frustrate the purpose of the guidelines. As we have already noted, the United States Sentencing Commission sought to ensure that United States District Court would continue to take into account 'all the relevant factors in a case.' Indeed, a cramped construction of the United States District Court's fact-finding power would have a perverse consequence: the standard of review for departures from the guidelines would be more deferential than the standard of review for applications of the guidelines. This disparity would arise because permits appellate modification to a sentence outside the range of the guidelines only if the sentence is not 'reasonable.' If factual findings were narrowly construed, and legal issues commensurately expanded, actual applications of the guidelines would be subject to review for legal error. United States District Court would have an incentive to insure against appellate reversal by footing their sentencing decisions on reasonable departures. Such a result would clearly undermine the purpose of the sentencing guidelines.

The standard of review which we establish today avoids this odd result.  We   will affirm sentences imposed by United States District Court who make factual  findings that are not clearly erroneous, and who apply the  United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines to those findings. In such cases, the sentencing judge  need not offer further reasons justifying the sentence.    When, however, the judge departs from the guideline range, an  additional reasonableness requirement applies: the judge must offer  reasons explaining why the departure is justified in terms of the  policies underlying the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines.
