The United States of America District Court's fact-finding power is an important guarantor of the practical judgment essential to any just sentencing procedure. As we have already mentioned, the guidelines statute expressly insulates such fact-finding against appellate attack. (endorsing the 'clearly erroneous' standard). Once the United States District Court has made factual findings, the United States Court of Appeals' sentence will be affirmed if it results from a proper application of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines to those facts. On the other hand, if the United States District Court applies the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines to the found facts and then departs from the resulting sentencing range, the United States District Court must offer acceptable reasons for its departure: a departure is subject to reversal unless it is 'reasonable.'
