Sentencing under the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines is not, however, an exact science. Justice cannot be meted out according to mathematical formulas. The universe of potential factors that might affect the seriousness of a given offense is too broad to be refined to a mechanistic approach. The United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines are not intended to cover all contingencies or rigidly bind United States District Court judges. The United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines do not impose the sentence, they provide a framework for a United States District Court to impose a sentence. 'The sentencing judge has an obligation to consider all the relevant factors in a case and to impose a sentence outside the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines in an appropriate case. The purpose of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines is to provide a structure for evaluating the fairness and appropriateness of the sentence for an individual offender, not to eliminate the thoughtful imposition of individualized sentences.' Senate Report No. 225, reprinted in 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.News 3182, 3235.
