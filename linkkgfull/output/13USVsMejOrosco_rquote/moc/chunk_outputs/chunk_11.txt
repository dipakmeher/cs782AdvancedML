The final sentencing range is calculated from a table by cross-referencing the offense level with Juventino Mejia-Orosco's criminal history category. The table sets sentencing ranges in which the maximum sentence exceeds the minimum by the greater of 6 months or 25%. This allows CLARK, District Judge of the Western District of Louisiana some latitude to fine tune the sentence to the individual offender and the circumstances of Juventino Mejia-Orosco's offense. The United States District Court may depart from the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines-specified sentence when it finds 'an aggravating or mitigating circumstance . . . that was not adequately taken into consideration by the United States Sentencing Commission. . . .' This discretion is narrowed by lists of those circumstances taken into consideration and those that do not justify a departure. See United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines at 5.25-5.34.

The United States District Court calculates the offense level and the criminal history category from the information contained in the pre-sentence report. Departures from the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines will also generally be justified from the information contained in this report. The accuracy of the presentence report, therefore, is critical to proper application of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, and strict compliance with the rules of criminal procedure governing this report is warranted.
