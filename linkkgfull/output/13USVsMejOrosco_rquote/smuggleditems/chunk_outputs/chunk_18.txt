A more exacting approach to appellate review of sentences would frustrate the purpose of the guidelines. As we have already noted, the United States Sentencing Commission sought to ensure that United States District Court would continue to take into account 'all the relevant factors in a case.' Indeed, a cramped construction of the United States District Court's fact-finding power would have a perverse consequence: the standard of review for departures from the guidelines would be more deferential than the standard of review for applications of the guidelines. This disparity would arise because permits appellate modification to a sentence outside the range of the guidelines only if the sentence is not 'reasonable.' If factual findings were narrowly construed, and legal issues commensurately expanded, actual applications of the guidelines would be subject to review for legal error. United States District Court would have an incentive to insure against appellate reversal by footing their sentencing decisions on reasonable departures. Such a result would clearly undermine the purpose of the sentencing guidelines.
