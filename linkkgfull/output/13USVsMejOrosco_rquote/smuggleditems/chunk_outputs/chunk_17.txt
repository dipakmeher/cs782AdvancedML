Is not the only guideline provision calling upon United States District Court judges to make sophisticated factual determinations. Sections 3B1.2 (requiring the judge to decide whether Juventino Mejia-Orosco was a 'minimal participant' or 'minor participant') and 3B1.3 (requiring CLARK, District Judge of the Western District of Louisiana to decide, among other things, whether Juventino Mejia-Orosco used a 'special skill') demand comparable findings. Judicial fact-finding upon these matters will, like determinations of manager status, enjoy the protection of the 'clearly erroneous' standard.
