The standard of review which we establish today avoids this odd result.  We   will affirm sentences imposed by United States District Court who make factual  findings that are not clearly erroneous, and who apply the  United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines to those findings. In such cases, the sentencing judge  need not offer further reasons justifying the sentence.    When, however, the judge departs from the guideline range, an  additional reasonableness requirement applies: the judge must offer  reasons explaining why the departure is justified in terms of the  policies underlying the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines. See .

Implicit in what we have said is the conclusion that the United States District Court's simple statement that the defendant is a 'manager' or 'leader' is a finding of fact. Building on the lesson of, we 'decline to require the judge to write out' more specific findings about the defendant. We recognize that so formal a requirement would interfere with the smooth operation of the sentencing hearing. In some instances, what is necessarily a 'judgment call' may not be susceptible of particularization. Nonetheless, we urge United States District Court to clarify their ultimate factual findings by more specific findings when possible. Specific findings will both guide United States Court of Appeals to the evidentiary basis for sentencing judgments, and also help the United States District Court to identify matters relevant to application of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines.
