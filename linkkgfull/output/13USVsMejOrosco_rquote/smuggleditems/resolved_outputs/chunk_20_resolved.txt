Application of the 'clearly erroneous' standard to Juventino Mejia-Orosco's case is easy. The United States District Court judge concluded that Juventino Mejia-Orosco was a manager or leader of human smuggling operation. The undisputed evidence that relatives of Hector Galvencio Paz-Ortega and Carlos Enrique Cruz-Morales were involved in the human smuggling operation provides sufficient support for this factual finding. The relatives either knew that they were aiding a human smuggling operation, in which case they were criminally responsible participants, or they were duped into aiding the human smuggling operation, in which case they were unwitting participants. In either case, the human smuggling operation was extensive within the meaning of United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines. We therefore see no reason to disturb the factual findings of United States District Court.

The judgment and sentence of the United States District Court is

AFFIRMED.
