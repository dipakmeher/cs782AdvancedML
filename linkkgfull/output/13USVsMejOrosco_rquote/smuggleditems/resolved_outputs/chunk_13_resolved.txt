The United States District Court also justified the 2-level increase by reference to the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, which requires a 2-level increase in the offense level if 'the defendant previously has been convicted of smuggling, transporting, or harboring an unlawful alien, or related offense. . . .' The United States District Court classed a previous conviction for unlawful entry as a 'related offense' because Juventino Mejia-Orosco was originally charged with transporting four illegal aliens, although he eventually pled guilty to a reduced charge of illegal entry. It is unclear whether the United States District Court intended to apply 2L1.1(b)(2) directly, or to use it as the basis for a departure from the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines. See § § 4A1.3, 5K2.0. Juventino Mejia-Orosco argues on appeal that the United States District Court misapplied the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines when it made these determinations and that this misapplication requires reversal of his sentence. Because we affirm based upon the United States Court of Appeals' first justification for the two-level increase, we do not reach the second.
