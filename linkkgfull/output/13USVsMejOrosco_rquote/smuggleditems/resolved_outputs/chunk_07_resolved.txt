By enacting the sentencing guidelines, United States Congress returned federal sentencing to an earlier philosophy that the punishment should fit the crime and that the main purpose of imprisonment is punishment. Edward M. Kennedy described the guidelines as 'a comprehensive and far reaching new approach . . . designed to reduce the unacceptable disparity of punishment that plagues the federal system, and . . . to assure sentences that are fair--and are perceived to be fair--to offenders, victims, and society.' 32 Fed.B. News & J. 60, 65 (1985). Similar crimes should be punished similarly. To accomplish this goal, United States Congress limited the discretion of United States District Court judges through the guidelines and made the sentence imposed for human smuggling operation determinate by abolishing parole. The United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines provide the analytic framework needed to create uniform sentences. The accompanying abolishment of parole ensures that the sentence imposed for human smuggling operation will be served.
