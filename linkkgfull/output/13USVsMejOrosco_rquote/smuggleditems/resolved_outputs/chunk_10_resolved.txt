Sentencing under the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines is based upon two factors--the offense and Juventino Mejia-Orosco's criminal history category. The statute under which Juventino Mejia-Orosco was convicted determines a base offense level of 18. This base level is then adjusted upward or lower by specified offense characteristics. For example, robbery has a base offense level of 18. This base level is increased incrementally if the amount taken in the robbery totals more than $2,500. The level is also increased if a firearm is used, more if the firearm is brandished, even more if discharged. Any bodily injury resulting from the crime also increases the offense level. Cooperation with United States Congress officials, on the other hand, decreases the offense level. Juventino Mejia-Orosco's criminal history category is calculated independently from the offense level and its incremental adjustments. One of six different categories is assigned Juventino Mejia-Orosco based upon a point scale. Points are assigned to prior convictions depending upon the length of sentence and whether the human smuggling operation was committed within two years of release from prison or while under any criminal sentence.
