The United States District Court found that Juventino Mejia-Orosco was 'a manager or leader of human smuggling operation.' To decide Juventino Mejia-Orosco's appeal of this finding, we must first determine whether the finding was factual or legal. We hold that it was factual. The determination of manager or leader of human smuggling operation status demands that the United States District Court draw an inference from a variety of data, including the information in the pre-sentence report and the defendant's statements and demeanor at the sentencing hearing. Of course, the fact of manager or leader of human smuggling operation status may be more difficult to ascertain than purely physical facts--such as whether the defendant carried a gun during commission of the crime--and may depend upon an assessment of the broad context of the human smuggling operation. But a complex fact is no less a fact.
