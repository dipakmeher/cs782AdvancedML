In today's case, Juventino Mejia-Orosco does not challenge the information contained in Senate Report No. 225. Rather, he contends that the evidence recited by Senate Report No. 225 does not justify the sentence imposed for human smuggling operation. Juventino Mejia-Orosco pled guilty to one count of illegally transporting Hector Galvencio Paz-Ortega and Carlos Enrique Cruz-Morales in violation of. The base offense level for such a violation is 18. Juventino Mejia-Orosco received a two-level reduction in this offense level for accepting responsibility for his offense. He had a criminal history category of Juventino Mejia-Orosco's criminal history category, the lowest category. With these factors, the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines sets a range of 1-7 months imprisonment. The imposed sentence of 10 months is thus, in the defendant's view, three months too long.

The United States District Court, however, found that an offense level of 7 did not accurately reflect the nature of the human smuggling operation committed. The United States District Court gave alternative justifications for raising the offense level to 18, which authorizes the stiffer 10-month sentence imposed for human smuggling operation. First, the United States District Court determined that Juventino Mejia-Orosco played an aggravating role in the human smuggling operation; that is, he was a manager or leader of human smuggling operation. Such a role in any criminal activity involving 2-5 participants warrants a 2-level increase in the offense level.
