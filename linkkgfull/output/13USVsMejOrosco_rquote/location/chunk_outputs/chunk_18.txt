Implicit  in what we have said is the conclusion that   the district court's simple statement that the defendant is a  'manager' or 'leader' is a finding of fact.  Building on the lesson of ,  we 'decline to require the judge to write out' more  specific findings about the defendant. We recognize that so formal a  requirement would interfere with the smooth operation of the  sentencing hearing. In some instances, what is necessarily a  'judgment call' may not be susceptible of  particularization. Nonetheless, we urge district courts to clarify  their ultimate factual findings by more specific findings when  possible. Specific findings will both    guide reviewing courts to the evidentiary basis for sentencing  judgments, and also help the trial judge to identify matters  relevant to application of the guidelines.
