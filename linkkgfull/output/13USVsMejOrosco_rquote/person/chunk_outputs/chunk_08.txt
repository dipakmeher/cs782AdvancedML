Sentencing  under the guidelines is not, however, an exact science. Justice  cannot be meted out according to mathematical formulas. The universe  of potential factors that might affect the seriousness of a given  offense is too broad to be refined to a mechanistic approach. The  sentencing guidelines are not intended to cover all contingencies or  rigidly bind district judges. The guidelines do not impose the  sentence, they provide a framework for a district court to impose a  sentence. 'The sentencing judge has an obligation to consider  all the relevant factors in a case and to impose a sentence outside  the guidelines in an appropriate case. The purpose of the sentencing  guidelines is to provide a structure for evaluating the fairness and  appropriateness of the sentence for an individual offender, not to  eliminate the thoughtful imposition of individualized sentences.'  S.Rep. No. 225, reprinted  in 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.News 3182, 3235.
