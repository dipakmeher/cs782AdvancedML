The  final sentencing range is calculated from a table by  cross-referencing the offense level with the defendant's criminal  history category. The table sets sentencing ranges in which the  maximum sentence exceeds the minimum by the greater of 6 months or  25%. This allows the district court some latitude to fine tune the  sentence to the individual defendant and the circumstances of the  defendant's offense.   The district court may depart from the guideline-specified    sentence when it finds 'an aggravating or mitigating  circumstance . . . that was not adequately taken into consideration  by the Sentencing Commission. . . .' .  This discretion is narrowed by lists of those circumstances taken  into consideration and those that do not justify a departure. See Guidelines at 5.25-5.34.

The district court calculates the offense level and the criminal  history category from the information contained in the pre-sentence  report. Departures from the guidelines will also generally be  justified from the information contained in this report. The  accuracy of the presentence report,    therefore, is critical to proper application of the sentencing  guidelines, and strict compliance with the rules of criminal  procedure governing this report is warranted. . .
