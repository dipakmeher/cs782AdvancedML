Mejia-Orosco  drove his van across the bridge into Laredo , Texas .  Paz-Ortega and Cruz-Morales waded the Rio Grande. They did not pass  through customs and had no legal right to enter this country.  Mejia-Orosco and the aliens then regrouped and spent two days in  Laredo. During this time, the group contacted relatives of the  aliens living in the United States. The family members were  instructed to wire Mejia-Orosco funds. He received $ 1,000 from  Paz-Ortega's family in Los Angeles and $ 1,700 from relatives of  Cruz-Morales living in New York City. Two days after arriving, the  three drove to the Laredo International Airport. Mejia-Orosco  supplied the aliens with airline tickets to San  Antonio and the key to a motel room there. Later, Mejia-Orosco met the  aliens at the motel and drove them to the San  Antonio International Airport. At the airport, Paz-Ortega was detained and  questioned by immigration officials. He admitted that he and  Cruz-Morales    had illegally entered the United States with the aid of  Mejia-Orosco. With this information, law enforcement officials were  able to locate and detain Cruz-Morales, who was aboard an airplane  awaiting departure to New York, and Mejia-Orosco. A search of  Mejia-Orosco's van uncovered 4,102 United States dollars and 574,000  Mexican pesos.
