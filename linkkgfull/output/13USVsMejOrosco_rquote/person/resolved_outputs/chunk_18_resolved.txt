The standard of review which we establish today avoids this odd result.  We   will affirm sentences imposed by district judges who make factual  findings that are not clearly erroneous, and who apply the  guidelines to those findings. In such cases, the sentencing judge  need not offer further reasons justifying the sentence.    When, however, the judge departs from the guideline range, an  additional reasonableness requirement applies: the judge must offer  reasons explaining why the departure is justified in terms of the  policies underlying the sentencing guidelines. See  .

Implicit  in what we have said is the conclusion that   the district court's simple statement that the defendant is a  'manager' or 'leader' is a finding of fact.  Building on the lesson of ,  we 'decline to require the judge to write out' more  specific findings about the defendant. We recognize that so formal a  requirement would interfere with the smooth operation of the  sentencing hearing. In some instances, what is necessarily a  'judgment call' may not be susceptible of  particularization. Nonetheless, we urge district courts to clarify  their ultimate factual findings by more specific findings when  possible. Specific findings will both    guide reviewing courts to the evidentiary basis for sentencing  judgments, and also help the trial judge to identify matters  relevant to application of the guidelines.
