Application of the 'clearly erroneous' standard to Juventino Mejia-Orosco's case is easy. The district judge concluded that Juventino Mejia-Orosco was a manager, supervisor, organizer, or leader of a criminal activity. The undisputed evidence that relatives of Hector Galvencio Paz-Ortega and Carlos Enrique Cruz-Morales were involved in the crime provides sufficient support for this factual finding. The relatives either knew that they were aiding a criminal enterprise, in which case they were criminally responsible participants, or they were duped into aiding the enterprise, in which case they were unwitting participants. In either case, the enterprise was extensive within the meaning of .  We therefore see no reason to disturb the factual findings of CLARK.

The judgment and sentence of the district court is

AFFIRMED.
