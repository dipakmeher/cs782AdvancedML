The district court found that Juventino Mejia-Orosco was 'an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor.' To decide Juventino Mejia-Orosco's appeal of this finding, we must first determine whether the finding was factual or legal. We hold that it was factual. The determination of manager status demands that the trial judge draw an inference from a variety of data, including the information in the pre-sentence report and the defendant's statements and demeanor at the sentencing hearing. Of course, the fact of manager status may be more difficult to ascertain than purely physical facts--such as whether the defendant carried a gun during commission of the crime--and may depend upon an assessment of the broad context of the crime. But a complex fact is no less a fact.
