Juventino Mejia-Orosco pled guilty to one count of illegally transporting aliens into the United States. He admits that he received $850 from each of the transported aliens in exchange for his illegal services. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison and fined $4,000. Juventino Mejia-Orosco's van, used to transport the aliens from Guatemala, has been seized pending forfeiture proceedings.

The district court calculated the sentence imposed on Juventino Mejia-Orosco according to the guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission. See. On appeal, Juventino Mejia-Orosco argues that the district court erroneously imposed a sentence of 10 months imprisonment. The guidelines, in Juventino Mejia-Orosco's view, would permit a maximum sentence of no more than 7 months. Juventino Mejia-Orosco's appeal is specifically authorized by statute.
