Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya contends further that his counsel was deficient for failing to object to the sentencing enhancements recommended in the PSR, based on jury findings that a ransom was demanded and that a dangerous weapon was used during the commission of the offense. Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya argues that the jury made these findings only in connection with the alien smuggling offenses committed under (counts one, two, and three), and not in connection with the hostage-taking offenses committed under (counts four and five). Because he was sentenced under the hostage-taking Guideline applicable to count four, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya complains that Adrian Almaguer erred by failing to object to the sentencing enhancements.

Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya is mistaken about the jury's findings. In its supplemental verdict, the jury expressly found that the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya and six co-defendants demanded a ransom in connection with the hostage-taking offenses charged in counts four and five. (Doc. # 177, at 6). Likewise, the jury found that the government had also proven that Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya and six co-defendants used a dangerous weapon in connection with counts four and five. ( Id. ). Because the jury findings support the enhancements for these specific offence characteristics under the relevant Guideline, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya fails to show that Adrian Almaguer was deficient for failing to object.
