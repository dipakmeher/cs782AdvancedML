Contrary  to Ibarra-Zelaya's claim, the record shows that his counsel did  raise an objection to the base offense level calculated in the PSR.  In his objections to the PSR, Ibarra-Zelaya's counsel objected that,  under the relevant version of ,  the base offense level should be 24, and not 32. (Doc. # 192). In  response to this objection, the Probation Department advised that  the relevant Guideline found in was amended on May 30, 2003. Prior to this amendment, had yielded a base offense level of 24. After this amendment,  however, the base offense level found in was increased to 32. Because the amendment was in effect well before  the offense was committed in Ibarra-Zelaya's case, the Probation  Department noted that both the Guidelines Manual issued on November  1, 2003, and the Guidelines Manual issued on November 1, 2004,  required a base offense level of 32. At sentencing, the Court noted  that the 2004 version of the Guidelines were "the same as the  2003 version," and overruled defense counsel's objection. (Doc.  # 324, Sentencing  Transcript, at 8). Subsequently,    Ibarra-Zelaya's  counsel acknowledged that he had incorrectly used an older version  of the Guidelines when he drafted his objection. ( Id. ).
