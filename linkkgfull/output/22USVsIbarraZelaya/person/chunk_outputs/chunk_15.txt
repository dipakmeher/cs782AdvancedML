Ibarra-Zelaya  contends further that his counsel was deficient for failing to  object to the sentencing enhancements recommended in the PSR, based  on jury findings that a ransom was demanded and that a dangerous  weapon was used during the commission of the offense. Ibarra-Zelaya  argues that the jury made these findings only in connection with the alien  smuggling offenses committed under (counts one, two, and three), and not in connection with the  hostage-taking offenses committed under (counts four and five). Because he was sentenced under the  hostage-taking Guideline applicable to count four, ,  Ibarra-Zelaya complains that his counsel erred by failing to object  to the sentencing enhancements.

Ibarra-Zelaya  is mistaken about the jury's findings. In its supplemental verdict,  the jury expressly found that the government had proven beyond a  reasonable doubt that the defendants demanded a ransom in connection  with the hostage-taking offenses charged in counts four and five.  (Doc. # 177, at 6). Likewise,    the  jury found that the government had also proven that the defendants  used a dangerous weapon in connection with counts four and five.  ( Id. ).  Because the jury findings support the enhancements for these  specific offence characteristics under the relevant Guideline,  Ibarra-Zelaya fails to show that his counsel was deficient for  failing to object.
