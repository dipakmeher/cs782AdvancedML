Counsel's  performance is constitutionally deficient if it falls below an  objective standard of reasonableness. See     (citing ),  .  Scrutiny of counsel's performance must be "highly deferential,"  and a reviewing court must make every effort "to eliminate the  distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of  counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from  counsel's perspective at the time." (quoting ).  There is a "strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls  within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance." Id. To prove prejudice, a defendant must show "that there is a  reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional  errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A  reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine  confidence in the outcome." (quoting ),  .  The deficiencies alleged by Ibarra-Zelaya are discussed separately  below under this standard.
