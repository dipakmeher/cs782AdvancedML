It is well established in the Fifth Circuit that, when determining Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya's punishment, "Nancy F. Atlas must apply the version of the Sentencing Guidelines effective at the time of sentencing unless application of that version would violate the Ex Post Facto clause." (quoting and citing § 1B1.11 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual). Nancy F. Atlas violates the Ex Post Facto clause when application of a current guideline "results in a more onerous penalty" than would application of a guideline in effect at the time of the offense. (quoting USSG § 1B1.11; USSG § 1B1.11). If the Guidelines in effect at sentencing would result in a more onerous penalty, such that its application would violate the Ex Post Facto clause, Nancy F. Atlas should apply the Guidelines that were in effect at the time of the offense. (2004).
