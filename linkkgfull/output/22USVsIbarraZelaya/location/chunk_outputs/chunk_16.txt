Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya contends further that his counsel was deficient for failing to object to the sentencing enhancements recommended in the PSR, based on jury findings that a ransom was demanded and that a dangerous weapon was used during the commission of the offense. Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya argues that the jury made these findings only in connection with the alien smuggling offenses committed under (counts one, two, and three), and not in connection with the hostage-taking offenses committed under (counts four and five). Because he was sentenced under the hostage-taking Guideline applicable to count four, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya complains that Adrian Almaguer erred by failing to object to the sentencing enhancements.
