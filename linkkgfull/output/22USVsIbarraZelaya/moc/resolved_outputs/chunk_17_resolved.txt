Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya contends further that his counsel, Adrian Almaguer, was deficient for failing to object to the sentencing enhancements recommended in the Presentence Report, based on a United States Federal Grand Jury findings that the ransom demand was demanded and that the dangerous weapon used in connection with the offense was used during the commission of the hostage-taking offense. Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya argues that a United States Federal Grand Jury made these findings only in connection with the illegal alien smuggling venture in March 2004 committed under (counts one, two, and three), and not in connection with the conspiracy to commit hostage taking offenses committed under (count four of the superseding indictment and five). Because he was sentenced under the hostage-taking Guideline applicable to count four of the superseding indictment, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya complains that Adrian Almaguer erred by failing to object to the sentencing enhancements.
