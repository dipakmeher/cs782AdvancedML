In summary, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya has not demonstrated that Adrian Almaguer's performance was deficient or that he suffered actual prejudice at his sentencing. Therefore, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya fails to establish a valid claim for ineffective assistance of counsel or to show that he is entitled to relief under on this issue. Because Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya has not shown that he is entitled to relief under on any of the issues he presents in his motion and supplemental memoranda, the United States of America's motion to dismiss is granted.

IV. EVIDENTIARY HEARING

A motion brought under may be denied without a hearing if the motion, files, and records of the case conclusively show that Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya is not entitled to relief. See (per curiam) (citing). The record in this case, as supplemented by an affidavit from Adrian Almaguer, is adequate to dispose fairly of the allegations made by Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya. Nancy F. Atlas need inquire no further on collateral review. Therefore, an evidentiary hearing is not necessary in this instance.
