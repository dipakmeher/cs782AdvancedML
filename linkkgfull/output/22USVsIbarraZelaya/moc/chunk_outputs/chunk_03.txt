On October 25, 2004, a United States Federal Grand Jury found Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya and his co-defendants guilty as charged on all of the counts alleged in the superseding indictment. (Doc. # 168). On October 27, 2004, the United States Federal Grand Jury returned a supplemental verdict as to counts one, two, and three of the indictment, finding that the offense involved between six and twenty-four aliens, and that a firearm was brandished or otherwise used and possessed. (Doc. # 177). As to counts four and five, the United States Federal Grand Jury found that the offense involved a demand for ransom and that a dangerous weapon was possessed. (See id.).

After the United States Federal Grand Jury returned its verdict, Nancy F. Atlas instructed the Probation Department to prepare a Presentence Report (a "PSR") for the purpose of determining punishment under the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. Because Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya was convicted of multiple counts of offenses arising under different statutes, his sentence was determined using the provisions found in the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, the offense level for the most serious of the counts among the group, i.e., the count resulting in the highest offense level, determines the relevant Guideline for the base offense level.
