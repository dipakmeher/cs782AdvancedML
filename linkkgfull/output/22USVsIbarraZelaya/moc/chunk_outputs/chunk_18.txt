Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya is mistaken about the United States Federal Grand Jury's findings. In its supplemental verdict, the United States Federal Grand Jury expressly found that the United States of America had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya and six co-defendants demanded a ransom in connection with the hostage-taking offenses charged in counts four and five. (Doc. # 177, at 6). Likewise, the United States Federal Grand Jury found that the United States of America had also proven that Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya and six co-defendants used a dangerous weapon in connection with counts four and five. ( Id. ). Because the United States Federal Grand Jury findings support the enhancements for these specific offence characteristics under the relevant Guideline, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya fails to show that Adrian Almaguer was deficient for failing to object.
