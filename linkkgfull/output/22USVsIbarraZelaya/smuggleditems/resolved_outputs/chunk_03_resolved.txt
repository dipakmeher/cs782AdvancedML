On October 25, 2004, a United States Federal Grand Jury found Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya and the six co-defendants guilty as charged on all of the five-count superseding indictment. (Doc. # 168). On October 27, 2004, a United States Federal Grand Jury returned the supplemental verdict as to counts one, two, and three of the superseding indictment, finding that the hostage-taking offense involved between six and twenty-four illegal aliens, and that a firearm was brandished or otherwise used and possessed. (Doc. # 177). As to count four of the superseding indictment and five, a United States Federal Grand Jury found that the hostage-taking offense involved a ransom demand and that the dangerous weapon used in connection with the offense was possessed. (See id.).

After a United States Federal Grand Jury returned the supplemental verdict, Nancy F. Atlas instructed the Probation Department to prepare the Presentence Report (a "Presentence Report") for the purpose of determining punishment under the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. Because Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya was convicted of multiple counts of offenses arising under different statutes, his sentence was determined using the provisions found in the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, the offense level for the most serious of the counts among the group, i.e., the count resulting in the highest offense level, determines the relevant Guideline for the base offense level.
