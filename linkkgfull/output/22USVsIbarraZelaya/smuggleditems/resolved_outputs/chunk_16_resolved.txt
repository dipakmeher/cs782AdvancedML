According to this record, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya fails to establish an ex post facto Law violation because the 2004 edition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual that was used to determine his sentence contained the same Guideline that was in effect at the time the offense occurred in March of 2004. Thus, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya has not demonstrated any error in the calculation of his sentence under the applicable version of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual or that his counsel, Adrian Almaguer, otherwise had a valid objection to make about the version that was used to determine his sentence. Absent a showing that counsel, Adrian Almaguer, failed to raise a meritorious objection and that the outcome would have been different, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya fails to demonstrate deficient performance or actual prejudice. See (holding that counsel was not deficient in failing to present a meritless argument) (citation omitted); ("Counsel is not deficient for, and prejudice does not issue from, failure to raise a legally meritless claim."). Accordingly, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya fails to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel on this issue.
