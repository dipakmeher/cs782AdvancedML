It is well established in The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that, when determining Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya's punishment, "Nancy F. Atlas must apply the version of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual effective at the time of sentencing unless application of that version would violate the ex post facto Law." (quoting and citing § 1B1.11 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual). Nancy F. Atlas violates the ex post facto Law when application of a current guideline "results in a more onerous penalty" than would application of a guideline in effect at the time of the offense. (quoting USSG § 1B1.11; USSG § 1B1.11). If the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual in effect at sentencing would result in a more onerous penalty, such that its application would violate the ex post facto Law, Nancy F. Atlas should apply the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual that were in effect at the time of the offense. (2004).
