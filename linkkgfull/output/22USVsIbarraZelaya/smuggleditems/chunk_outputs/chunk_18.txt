Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya is mistaken about a United States Federal Grand Jury's findings. In its supplemental verdict, a United States Federal Grand Jury expressly found that the United States of America had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya and the six co-defendants demanded the ransom demand made during the commission of the offense in connection with the hostage-taking offense charged in count four of the superseding indictment. (Doc. # 177, at 6). Likewise, a United States Federal Grand Jury found that the United States of America had also proven that Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya and the six co-defendants used the dangerous weapon used in connection with the offense in connection with count four of the superseding indictment. ( Id. ). Because a United States Federal Grand Jury findings support the enhancements for these specific offence characteristics under the relevant Guideline, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya fails to show that Adrian Almaguer was deficient for failing to object.
