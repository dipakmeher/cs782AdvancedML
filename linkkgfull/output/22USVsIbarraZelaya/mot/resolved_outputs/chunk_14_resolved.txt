Contrary to Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya's claim, the record shows that his counsel, Adrian Almaguer, did raise an objection to the base offense level calculated in the PSR. In his objections to the PSR, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya's counsel, Adrian Almaguer, objected that, under the relevant version of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, the base offense level should be 24, and not 32. (Doc. # 192). In response to this objection, the Probation Department advised that the relevant Guideline found in the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual was amended on May 30, 2003. Prior to this amendment, the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual had yielded a base offense level of 24. After this amendment, however, the base offense level found in the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual was increased to 32. Because the amendment was in effect well before the offense was committed in Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya's case, the Probation Department noted that both the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual issued on November 1, 2003, and the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual issued on November 1, 2004, required a base offense level of 32. At sentencing, Nancy F. Atlas noted that the 2004 version of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual were "the same as the 2003 version," and overruled defense counsel's, Adrian Almaguer's, objection. (Doc. # 324, Sentencing Transcript, at 8). Subsequently, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya's counsel, Adrian Almaguer, acknowledged that he had incorrectly used an older version of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual when he drafted his objection.
