Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya is mistaken about the jury's findings. In its supplemental verdict, the jury expressly found that the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya and six co-defendants demanded a ransom in connection with the hostage-taking offenses charged in counts four and five. (Doc. # 177, at 6). Likewise, the jury found that the government had also proven that Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya and six co-defendants used a dangerous weapon in connection with counts four and five. ( Id. ). Because the jury findings support the enhancements for these specific offence characteristics under the relevant Guideline, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya fails to show that Adrian Almaguer was deficient for failing to object.

In summary, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya has not demonstrated that Adrian Almaguer's performance was deficient or that he suffered actual prejudice at his sentencing. Therefore, Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya fails to establish a valid claim for ineffective assistance of counsel or to show that he is entitled to relief under on this issue. Because Jose Marlon Ibarra-Zelaya has not shown that he is entitled to relief under on any of the issues he presents in his motion and supplemental memoranda, the government's motion to dismiss is granted.
