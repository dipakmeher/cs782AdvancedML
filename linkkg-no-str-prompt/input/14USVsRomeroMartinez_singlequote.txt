Carlos Martinez-Romero is a Defendant.

Appellant  Carlos Martinez-Romero was convicted of possession of marijuana. On  appeal appellant argues the trial court erred in overruling his  motion to suppress evidence of the marijuana. Appellant based his  motion to suppress on a lack of reasonable suspicion for a vehicle  stop at the border. Because we agree with the trial court that  enough factors existed to justify the stop under the totality of the  circumstances, we affirm the trial court's judgment. 


 FACTUAL  AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 

 At  approximately noon on May 24, 1998, Border Patrol Agent David  Fitzgerald conducted an investigatory stop of appellant as he  traveled north on Interstate 35 in a crew-cab truck. The stop took  place in Cotulla, Texas, approximately sixty-eight miles from    the Texas-Mexico border. Conversing with appellant in both Spanish  and English, Agent Fitzgerald requested that appellant produce proof  of citizenship. Appellant presented proper proof of Mexican  citizenship as well as a valid border-crosser card. While standing  by the vehicle, Agent Fitzgerald noticed the strong odor of carpet  freshener and observed freshener sprinkled on the floorboard of the  truck. Suspecting that appellant used the deodorizer to eliminate  the scent of illegal drugs, Agent Fitzgerald obtained appellant's  consent to examine a toolbox located in the back of the truck.  Although appellant denied possessing the key, Agent Fitzgerald  opened the toolbox with a key attached to the ignition and found six  bundles of marijuana totaling one hundred and sixty-nine pounds.  Fitzgerald arrested appellant for illegal drug possession. A jury  found appellant guilty of possession and imposed a sentence of seven  years imprisonment. In a single issue, appellant argues no  reasonable suspicion existed to authorize the stop and therefore the  trial court erred in admitting the evidence of marijuana at trial. 


 STANDARD  OF REVIEW 

   Challenges to findings of reasonable suspicion involve    mixed questions of law and fact. .  Although we pay deference to historical facts, we review de  novo mixed questions of law and fact. .  We review all facts under the totality of the circumstances, rather  than in isolation. Id.   


 REASONABLE  SUSPICION 

   Both the United States and Texas constitutions protect individuals  from unreasonable searches and seizures. ; .  Despite evolving standards in the area of roving border patrol stops ,  the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in . 

 Characteristics  of Area and Proximity to Border 

 We  quickly    note   both federal and state guidelines limit a reasonable proximity to  stops conducted within fifty miles of the border. See (holding  a stop sixty miles from the border insufficient to establish that  the vehicle originated from the border); (finding that stop conducted ninety miles from the border amounted  to mere suspicion that vehicle came from the border). 

 Here,  neither the State nor appellant contest that the arresting officer  conducted the stop approximately sixty-eight miles from the border.  Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of appellant.  

 Officer's  Previous Experience   

 Agent  Fitzgerald testified that in his four years of experience as a  Border Patrol Agent, crew-cab trucks missing a backseat, similar to  that which the appellant drove, invariably indicate the stowage of  illegal aliens or narcotics. Fitzgerald testified, 'I've never  seen a vehicle that was modified in such a way that was not used for  either transporting illegal aliens or narcotics.' 

 Appellant  stresses that Agent Fitzgerald was not a credible witness  because    he only conducted one other narcotics arrest. Further, appellant  argued that Agent Fitzgerald's testimony lacked credibility because  the State failed to introduce the number of stops the agent made per  week and the success rate of these stops. These allegations are  unpersuasive on appeal because   the trial judge is the sole and exclusive trier of facts and the  judge of the credibility of witnesses at suppression hearings. See . 


 

 Driver's  Behavior   

 As  one of the stated reasons for the stop, Agent Fitzgerald noticed  that appellant was traveling at a very low rate of speed when  Fitzgerald first passed him. Fitzgerald testified that appellant  traveled approximately fifty miles per hour on IH-35 where the  stated speed limit was seventy miles per hour. Additionally,  Fitzgerald observed that appellant appeared very tense and rigid.  When Fitzgerald turned his vehicle around to follow appellant, he  testified that appellant consistently looked in his rear-view mirror  and weaved within his lane. Further, Fitzgerald testified that as he  pulled alongside appellant's truck, appellant moved away from the  wheel    and attempted to position himself between the door jamb in between  the front door and the crew-cab section of the truck. While glances  in one's rear-view mirror do not necessarily constitute peculiar  behavior, we agree that appellant's attempts to hide himself from  Fitzgerald's view qualify as a suspicious activity. 

 Physical  Aspects of the Vehicle 

 Fitzgerald  cited the modification to the crew-cab's backseat as another  articulated reason for conducting the stop. When Fitzgerald first  passed appellant he observed that the back seat was missing. As  discussed earlier, consistent with the agent's testimony regarding  previous illegal alien and narcotics stops, often the back seat area  of crew-cabs provides the stow-away location. In fact, Fitzgerald  testified that in his experience as a Border Patrol Agent, never had  he encountered a modification like that on appellant's truck which  did not serve an illegal purpose. 

 Vehicle  Registration 

 Prior  to the stop, Fitzgerald ran a license and vehicle registration check  on appellant's truck. Fitzgerald discovered the vehicle was  registered in Edna, Texas. Fitzgerald testified that in his  experience, several of the alien-smuggling    vehicles he apprehended in the past originated from Edna, a suburb  of Dallas. See (citing border patrol's experience that many smugglers travel en  route to larger cities such as Austin, San  Antonio ,  and Dallas, and thus vehicle registration in Dallas to an individual  other than the defendant contributed to patrol's decision to detain  vehicle). 

 When  we consider all of these factors under the Woods totality of the circumstances test, we hold the trial court properly  determined that reasonable suspicion existed to justify the stop.  The agent's experience, the vehicle's registration and physical  characteristics, appellant's behavior, and the inferences that could  be drawn from these facts, established reasonable suspicion.  Accordingly, we overrule appellant's sole issue and affirm the trial  court's judgment.

 E nd  of Document   

 1  In ,  the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals established a new reasonableness  standard in evaluating roving patrol stops. The Woods court  eliminated the former 'consistent with innocent activity as  with criminal activity' test for reasonable suspicion and set  out the 'totality of the circumstances' test as the  current standard.
