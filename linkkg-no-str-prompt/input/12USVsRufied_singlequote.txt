 PROBABLE  CAUSE FINDING 


 I.  Facts 

 Yusif  Ahmed Rufied ('Defendant') was charged by criminal  complaint on May 26, 2006, with unlawfully transporting sixty (60)  illegal aliens by means of a motor vehicle within the Southern  District of Texas in knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact  that said aliens had come to, entered, or remained in the United  States in violation of law, and transported or moved said aliens  within the United States by means of a motor vehicle or otherwise in  violation of .  On June 2, 2006, this court held a preliminary examination hearing  to determine whether there was probable cause to detain Defendant. 

 At  the preliminary examination hearing, the government presented  Immigration and Customs Enforcement ('ICE') Agent Bruce  Henderson ('Agent Henderson') as its    sole witness. Agent Henderson testified that on May 24, 2006, he was  working with ICE Agent Joe Silva when they were called to the Border  Patrol check point located on Highway 59. Agent Henderson stated  that Agent Silva received a duty call from Border Patrol Agent  Flores stating that sixty (60) undocumented aliens were found in a  tractor trailer. Agent Henderson testified that he arrived at the  checkpoint with Agent Silva at approximately 10:45 a.m. Agent  Henderson stated that when he arrived at the checkpoint he saw the  tractor trailer and was introduced to some of the undocumented  aliens found in the trailer. Agent Henderson stated that there were  fifty-nine (59) aliens present at the checkpoint and one (1) alien  in the hospital due to taking an improper medication. Agent  Henderson testified that Border Patrol Agents advised him that the  tractor trailer arrived at the check point at approximately 6:45  a.m. and during a secondary inspection sixty (60) aliens were found  in the rear of the trailer. 

 Agent  Henderson testified that Defendant was in the cab of the tractor  trailer with Martin Adaboh ('Codefendant'). Agent  Henderson identified Defendant as the individual in the  courtroom    wearing an orange jumpsuit. Agent Henderson stated that Defendant  and Codefendant are both from Ghana, Africa and both live in Quebec,  Montreal, Canada. Agent Henderson testified that Codefendant and  Defendant were arrested and read their rights. Agent Henderson  stated that he attempted to speak with Codefenant first, but was  unable to speak with Codefendant because Codefendant requested an  attorney. Agent Henderson testified that he spoke with Defendant,  and Defendant claimed that he was a driver in training, that he  never drove the tractor trailer, and that he was not receiving  payment for transporting aliens. 

 Agent  Henderson testified that Defendant said he stayed at the Monterrey  Inn in Laredo , Texas on the night of May 23, 2006, and that Codefendant stayed in a room  while Defendant slept in the tractor from Midnight to 6:00 a.m.  Agent Henderson testified that according to Defendant, Codefendant  met a woman by the name of Claudia in the hallway of the Monterrey  Inn. 

 Agent  Henderson spoke with material witnesses that claimed to be loaded  into the trailer at 5:30 a.m. on May 24, 2006, during the period  Defendant claims he was sleeping in the tractor. 

 Agent  Henderson testified    that the aliens were loaded at Diesel Impact 2000 off of Highway  359. Agent Henderson described the terrain leading into Diesel 2000  as a rough caliche road, with a steep grade, and deep indentations.  Agent Henderson testified that Defendant claimed the tractor stopped  on the side of the highway and that Codefendant told Defendant he  was checking the tires. 

 Agent  Henderson stated that Codefendant later changed his mind about  speaking with ICE agents and was read his rights and interviewed on  May 24, 2006. Agent Henderson testified that Codefendant claimed  that while staying at the Monterrey Inn, Codefendant was approached  to smuggle  aliens by a woman named Claudia. Agent Henderson testified that Codefendant  stated that on the morning of May 24, 2006, Claudia, Codefendant,  and Defendant went to Diesel 2000, and all were present at the rear  of the trailer when the aliens were loaded. Agent Henderson stated  that once the aliens were loaded, a seal was placed on the door of  the trailer. 

 Agent  Henderson testified that Codefendant described the area surrounding  Diesel 2000 and could show Agent Henderson where it was located.  Agent Henderson stated that Codefendant did not state the  exact    amount of the payment he was going to receive for transporting the  aliens and never claimed that he was going to pay Defendant. Agent  Henderson stated that Codefendant stated that he started with $  10,000, gave $ 3000 to his wife, gave Defendant $ 1000, and  Codefendant was left with $ 7,000 found at the time he was arrested. 

 Agent  Henderson testified that Defendant claimed that they were going to  McAllen, Texas; Codefendant claimed that they were going to San  Antonio ,  Texas; and the trucking dispatcher stated that Defendant and  Codefendant were to pick up a load in Laredo , Texas and return to Canada. Agent Henderson testified that Codefendant  stated that Defendant was awake in the front seat when they went to  Diesel 2000. Agent Henderson also stated that there was no load in  the trailer, except for the aliens, when Defendant was stopped at  the Highway 59 Checkpoint. Agent Henderson testified that a person  does not travel on Highway 59 to get to San  Antonio or McAllen. 

 Defense  counsel cross-examined Agent Henderson regarding the investigation.  Agent Henderson stated that although there were only two seats in  the cab, Claudia may have sat in the bunk. Agent Henderson  reiterated that    Codefendant's statement was taken five hours after Defendant's  statement was taken, and that at the time of arriving at the scene  only Defendant and not Codefendant spoke to agents. Agent Henderson  also reiterated that Defendant stated that Codefendant spoke with a  lady by the name of Claudia and that Defendant stated that he slept  in the truck. Agent Henderson testified that one material witness  identified Codefendant as the driver and the person that was present  at the rear of the trailer while the trailer was being loaded with  aliens. However, Agent Henderson also stated that the other material  witnesses identified a person with black skin color as the person  loading the trailer. Agent Henderson testified that there were no  justifiable facts that the $ 1700 found in Defendant's possession  was from this incident. Agent Henderson reiterated that the  Codefendant never mentioned that Defendant was getting paid. Agent  Henderson reiterated that the primary agent on the scene informed  Agent Henderson that Defendant was in the passenger seat of the  truck. Other than the cross-examination, Defendant did not present  any additional testimony as to probable cause. 


 II.  Analysis 

 Preliminary    examination hearings afford magistrates an opportunity to determine  whether there is probable cause to detain a defendant. I Fed. Prac.  & Proc. Crim.3d § 86 (R 5.1). There is a two-part test to  determine whether probable cause exists: belief that an offense has  been committed; and belief that the defendant committed it. See  .  The probable cause threshold is low. A magistrate may find probable  cause if the government shows 'evidence sufficient to cause a  person of ordinary prudence and caution to conscientiously entertain  a reasonable belief of the accused's guilt.' 1 Fed. Prac. &  Proc. Crim.3d § 86 n.3 ( )  (internal quotations and citations omitted). 

 Additionally,  according to ,  'the finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay  evidence in  whole or in part .'  (emphasis added). Based on the testimony, the government has met its  burden. The government presented evidence that an offense was  committed by showing that sixty (60) undocumented aliens were found  in a tractor trailer Defendant was riding in. The government    presented testimony from Agent Henderson showing that a person of  ordinary prudence and caution could conscientiously entertain a  reasonable belief of the accused's guilt; specifically, that  Defendant was riding in the passenger seat of the tractor trailer  and Defendant helped load undocumented aliens into the trailer. 


 III.  Finding 

 Based  on the evidence presented, THIS  COURT FINDS THAT THERE IS PROBABLE CAUSE to hold the defendant to answer in district court, in  accordance with . 

 DONE  at Laredo , Texas ,  this 7th day of June, 2006.
