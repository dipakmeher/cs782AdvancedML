 REPORT  AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE 

 To  the Honorable Chief United States District Judge Orlando L. Garcia : 

 This  Report and Recommendation concerns Defendant's Motion to Suppress  #38, which was referred to the undersigned for a report and  recommendation pursuant to Western District of Texas Local Rule  CV-72 and Appendix C. The undersigned therefore has authority to  enter this recommendation pursuant to .  For the reasons set forth below, it is recommended that Defendant's  Motion to Suppress #38 be DENIED . 


 I.  Background 

 Defendant  Alfonso Cano-Tovar ('Cano') was indicted on March 4, 2020,  on three counts of transporting and conspiring to transport illegal  aliens in violation of .  The indictment resulted from an investigatory stop by Border Patrol  agents near Encinal, Texas. Cano was found to be the driver of a  pickup    truck containing four undocumented Mexican nationals confessing to  have recently crossed illegally into the United States. Cano now  moves to suppress all evidence and statements obtained as a result  of what he alleges was an illegal seizure. Cano argues that the  border patrol agents who stopped his vehicle lacked reasonable  suspicion or probable cause to believe that illegal activity was  afoot. 

 The  Government responds that the motion to suppress should be denied on  its merits because the Border Patrol had reasonable suspicion to  justify the investigatory stop and seizure of Cano. In addition, the  Government challenges Cano's standing to challenge the seizure  because Cano was driving a stolen vehicle, in which he has no  expectation of privacy, and that the evidence, even if the fruit of  an illegal seizure, is nonetheless admissible under the inevitable  discovery doctrine. 

 The  Court held a hearing on the motion on November 10, 2020, at which  counsel for both parties and Cano were present and at which Border  Patrol Agent Paul Silva provided live testimony. At the close of the  hearing, the Court instructed the parties that they could submit  post-hearing written briefing within seven days.    In issuing this recommendation, in addition to considering the  Government's response to Cano's motion #41 and Cano's reply in  support #46, the undersigned has also considered the Government's  Memo Following Suppression Hearing #58. 


 II.  Legal Standard 

 The protects against unlawful searches and seizures and extends to brief  investigatory stops of persons or vehicles that fall short of a  traditional arrest. (citing .  Because Cano was seized without a warrant, the Government bears the  burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the seizure  complied with the . ; . 

 A  temporary detention of a vehicle occupant for investigatory purposes  is constitutional if, at a minimum, the Border Patrol agent  reasonably suspects that the occupant of the vehicle is involved in  illegal activity. .  Reasonable suspicion is something less than probable cause, but  something more than an agent's 'hunch.' — .  Suspicion is reasonable if, taking into consideration the totality  of the circumstances, it is based on specific and articulable facts  and the rational inferences that can be drawn therefrom. . 

 In  the context of investigatory stops by Border Patrol agents, the  Supreme Court    has articulated a list of non-exclusive factors for courts to  consider in assessing reasonable suspicion. .  These factors include the following: (1) the agent's experience in  detecting illegal activity; (2) proximity of the area where the  investigatory stop occurred to an international border; (3) the  area's known characteristics for illegal activity; (4) information  about recent illegal activity in the area; (5) the area's usual  traffic patterns; (6) erratic driving or obvious attempts to evade  agents; (7) the type of vehicle and other characteristics of the  vehicle known to the agents to be frequently used in illegal  activity including whether the vehicle is riding low or its  suspension is modified; and (8) the number, appearance, and behavior  of the occupants of the vehicle. (listing Brignoni-Ponce factors). 


 III.  Testimony and Evidence 

 The  evidence and testimony of Border Patrol Agent Paul Silva presented  at the hearing established the following facts by a preponderance of  the evidence. On the afternoon of February 13, 2020, the Cotulla  Border Patrol Station received a phone call from the Encinal Police  Department stating that a concerned citizen had seen four possible  illegal aliens    load in a white, older Ford pickup truck near the Ranch House Café  heading west on Highway 44 towards Highway 83. The Ranch House Café  is a restaurant located on an otherwise undeveloped stretch of  highway in South Texas and has been closed for an extended period of  time. The area where the restaurant is located is in close proximity  to the Mexican border in an area where there are very few roads and  very little local traffic and is a known hot spot for alien  smuggling .  Agent Silva, a Border Patrol agent with 23 years of experience,  testified that aliens enter at this point of the border because it  is north of both the border checkpoint in Laredo , Texas ,  and an additional checkpoint on Highway 83. He further testified  that the parking lot of the Ranch House Café is specifically known  as a meeting place for loading illegal aliens who have recently  crossed the border into vehicles. Although Silva did not testify to  the precise number of miles between the Ranch House Café and the  border, he testified that the area is accessible by foot by those  crossing the border. A map of the area used as a visual aid at the  Court's hearing demonstrates that the town of Laredo, which is  approximately    43 miles from the Ranch House Café, is a significantly longer  distance from the Café than the closest portion of the Mexican  border. 

 At  approximately 3:15 p.m. on the day in question, Agent Silva was  conducting a roving patrol around the intersection of Interstate 35  and Route 133 when he heard the report on his service radio about  the white pickup truck possibly loaded with illegal aliens. The  report indicated that the truck was seen headed west on Highway 44  towards Highway 83, an intersection about five miles west of the  Ranch House Café. Route 133, where Agent Silva was patrolling, runs  parallel to Highway 44 and also intersects with Highway 83 to the  north. In response to the report, Silva drove toward Highway 83 and  headed south, hoping to intercept the vehicle. 

 According  to Silva, Border Patrol Agent Ezequiel Ramirez was the first to spot  the vehicle heading north on Highway 83, away from the border. He  reported the vehicle's location to Agent Fred Martinez, Jr., another  roving Border Patrol Agent in the area, who also saw the vehicle  traveling north. Agent Silva, who was parked on the side of the road  at the time, heard Ramirez and Martinez both confirm over radio  communication    that the vehicle matched the description heard on the service radio.  Agent Ramirez further relayed that he had seen both a driver and a  front-seat passenger in the truck's cab. When the vehicle reached  Agent Silva's location approximately two or three minutes later,  however, Silva observed only a driver in the vehicle; no passenger  was visible. At that point, Silva became increasingly suspicious  that the vehicle contained illegal aliens hiding from Border Patrol.  He pulled out behind the vehicle, identified the license plate  number, and ran a search on the registration. The vehicle was  approaching a sharp 90-degree turn and was traveling at a fairly  high speed. At that point, Agent Silva activated his lights and  decided to pull over the vehicle. When Silva approached the vehicle,  he saw several individuals laying in the rear of the cab of the  truck and the front passenger crouched between the dashboard and the  front seat. 

 Although  the results from the license plate search had not yet come through  at the time of the stop, Agent Silva obtained the vehicle's Vehicle  Identification Number ('VIN') and discovered that it did  not match the license plate. When he later ran the VIN in his  system,    he discovered the vehicle had been stolen. The results of the  license plate check ultimately established that the license plate  affixed to the stolen truck was associated with a silver Ford  pickup. Agent Silva testified that if he had discovered the  mismatched license plate while on roving patrol, he would have  pulled over the vehicle on suspicion that the driver had  intentionally switched the plates because the vehicle was likely  stolen and was hiding illegal aliens. 

 Cano  and the other occupants of the vehicle were taken to the Cotulla  Border Patrol Station for further processing. At the station,  several of the passengers admitted to being from Mexico and having  recently crossed illegally into the United States. Cano was advised  of his Miranda rights and gave a statement to Border Patrol agents admitting that  he was hired to drive the aliens and that the truck and gas money  were provided to him for the purpose of smuggling  the aliens . 


 IV.  Analysis 

 The  Government contends that Cano lacks standing to challenge the  lawfulness of his stop because Cano had no expectation of privacy in  the vehicle he was driving because it was stolen. The Government  also argues that Agent Silva had reasonable    suspicion to conduct the investigatory stop and ultimate seizure of  Cano, and, in any event, would have inevitably discovered that the  vehicle was stolen, which would have provided an independent basis  for the stop. For the reasons that follow, the undersigned concludes  that the Government's standing challenge is meritless, but that the  Government has nonetheless established by a preponderance of the  evidence that Agent Silva had the requisite reasonable suspicion of  illegal activity to pull over Cano. Therefore, the inevitable  discovery argument need not be reached, and Cano's motion to  suppress should be denied. 


 A.  Standing 

 The  Government argues that Cano lacks standing to challenge the  investigatory stop leading to his arrest because the vehicle he was  driving was stolen. To establish standing to challenge a search and  seizure under the ,  a defendant must demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy  that was violated by the challenged Government conduct. See  generally (citing .  Cano bears the burden of establishing that he had a reasonable and  legitimate expectation of privacy related to his seizure. . 

 In  support of its argument that Cano lacks standing, the Government  directs    the Court to the Fifth Circuit's decision in  ,  in which the Fifth Circuit held that the possessor of a stolen  automobile lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy in  the vehicle to challenge the search of that vehicle. .  The Fifth Circuit distinguished a vehicle search from a search of  the person, explaining that the driver of a stolen vehicle 'does,  of course, have standing to challenge the search of his person.' Id. The search at issue in Lanford involved the search of the stolen vehicle, which resulted in the  discovery of over four thousand dollars and the ultimate indictment  of the driver of the vehicle for robbery of a federally-insured  savings and loan and the interstate transportation of a stolen  vehicle. .  The principle established in Lanford has been applied repeatedly in this Circuit to deny motions to  suppress where a defendant is attempting to challenge the search of  stolen property. See,  e.g., (denying motion to suppress because defendant lacked standing to  challenge the search of the contents of a stolen camera found in his  vehicle during search); (denying motion to suppress where defendant failed to establish  legitimate expectation of privacy    in search of vehicle, which resulted in discovery of a firearm on  the driver's side floorboard). 

 Contrary  to the Government's arguments, however, Lanford is inapposite because the evidence Cano seeks to suppress through  his challenge was not obtained as a result of a search of stolen  property. The Government attempts to argue that it was the search of  the stolen truck that resulted in the discovery of the illegal  aliens Cano was hired to transport. But the testimony provided by  Agent Silva does not support the Government's characterization of  Cano's encounter with Border Patrol. Agent Silva testified that he  pulled over Cano and immediately saw the illegal aliens in the truck  through the window when he approached the vehicle. The only item  discovered as a result of a search was a personal use amount of  methamphetamine discovered on Cano's person. As the Court clearly  stated in Lanford ,  a defendant does not lose his ability to challenge a search of his  person merely because he is in possession of stolen property or  driving a stolen vehicle. .  Nor has the Government directed the Court to any authority  suggesting that a defendant is prohibited from challenging his  seizure through an investigatory    stop or otherwise because he was at the time of the seizure in the  possession of stolen property. 

 In  defense of his standing to challenge his seizure, Cano argues that a  traffic stop results in the seizure of both the driver and passenger  alike, and that both individuals have standing to challenge the stop  as unconstitutional, even where the passenger lacks a privacy  interest in the car and does not have standing to challenge the  search of the vehicle. See .  Cano has established that although he would have lacked standing to  challenge the search of the stolen truck (had one occurred), he does  have standing to challenge the stop resulting in the seizure of his  person to argue for the suppression of the observation of the  illegal aliens in plain view and the statements both the aliens and  Cano provided during their seizure. 


 B. Challenge 

 Although  Cano has established his standing to challenge the investigatory  stop leading to his indictment for alien  smuggling ,  the Government has also established by the preponderance of the  evidence that Agent Silva had reasonable suspicion, based on the  totality of the circumstances, to stop Cano and investigate whether  he was engaged in illegal activity.    Applying the Brignoni-Ponce factors to the instant case, the evidence establishes that Agent  Silva has over twenty years of experience working as a Border Patrol  agent detecting the specific type of illegal activity at issue in  this case. See (listing first factor as agent's experience in detecting illegal  activity). As to the second factor, the area in which Agent Silva  stopped Cano was in close 'proximity' to the  'international border' with Mexico, so close in fact that  many illegal aliens travel across the border by foot in this area. See  id. The Fifth Circuit has articulated a benchmark of 50 miles or less  when evaluating closeness of a given location to an international  border. See .  The fact that an encounter with Border Patrol occurs within this  benchmark has been referred to as a 'paramount factor' in  assessing reasonable suspicion. (internal quotation and citation omitted). Regarding the third and  fifth factors, the area's known characteristics for illegal activity  and local traffic patterns, the undisputed testimony established  that the area in which the stop occurred was a known 'hot spot'  for alien  smuggling where there was minimal local traffic. See . 

 The  fourth factor,    information regarding recent illegal activity in the area,  contributed significantly to Agent Silva's reasonable suspicion that  the vehicle Cano was driving was engaged in illegal activity. Under  certain circumstances, anonymous tips such as the one relayed over  the Border Patrol radio system, can demonstrate 'sufficient  indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make an  investigatory stop.' (internal quotation and citation omitted). One of the factors in  determining whether a tip is reliable such that it can be factored  into the reasonable suspicion calculus is whether it can be  corroborated in some manner by independent police work. .  For example, in  ,  the Supreme Court held that an anonymous tip that a woman would  drive from a particular apartment building to a specific motel in a  brown Plymouth station wagon with a broken tail light and would be  transporting cocaine was sufficiently reliable to create reasonable  suspicion of criminal activity, even without any additional factors,  because it accurately predicted future behavior and demonstrated a  special familiarity with the woman's affairs. . 

 In  assessing the reliability of anonymous tips to be on    the lookout ('BOLO') for specific criminal activity, the  Fifth Circuit has directed courts to evaluate several factors,  including: (1) the credibility and reliability of the informant; (2)  the specificity of the information contained in the tip or BOLO  report; (3) the ability of officers in the field to verify the  information in the field; and (4) whether the tip deals with active  or recent activity. .  Although Agent Silva did not provide any testimony regarding the  credibility and reliability of the anonymous tip regarding possible alien  smuggling ,  the tip was based on contemporaneous observation by a concerned  citizen of someone loading four possibly illegal aliens in a white,  older Ford pickup truck at a known location where alien smugglers  pick up aliens having recently crossed the border on foot. The tip  in this case provided both a specific physical description of the  truck and the direction it was traveling. Independent investigatory  work by Agents Ramirez, Martinez, and Silva corroborated the  description of the truck and found it traveling in the direction  described by the person providing the anonymous tip. The tip in this  case is distinguishable from those instances in which    a tip encompasses only general allegations of illegal activity,  lacks such specificity, and fails to predict any future behavior  that through corroboration by law enforcement confirms the tipster's  credibility. Cf. (holding that bare-bones tip that young black male in plaid shirt  standing at a bus stop was carrying a gun was insufficient to supply  reasonable suspicion in support of investigatory stop where tipster  did not explain how he knew about the gun and there was no means to  independently assess tipster's credibility). 

 The  final factor that is significant to the assessment of reasonable  suspicion is the number, appearance, and behavior of the occupants  in the vehicle. .  Agent Silva testified that his suspicion of possible illegal  activity increased significantly when he encountered the truck and  saw only a driver in the cab, as opposed to the two individuals seen  only minutes earlier by Agents Ramirez and Martinez, and the four  individuals seen by the person who made the anonymous tip.  Accordingly, Agent Silva believed that the passengers in the vehicle  had ducked and were presumably hiding after seeing Border Patrol  vehicles on the roadway. The Fifth Circuit has recognized  that    an 'affirmative indication of an attempt to hide,' as  opposed to mere slouching in a seat or bearing a suspicious facial  expression, is required for this factor to weigh in favor of the  presence of reasonable suspicion. . Compare (finding reasonable suspicion where, upon seeing agents, defendant  looked surprised, ducked down, slumped back in his seat, and rolled  up his tinted window) with (agent lacked reasonable suspicion to stop vehicle in an area known  for drug smuggling only 500 yards from the border based solely on an  observation that the occupants were 'sweating pretty bad'  and bore 'stone-faced' expressions). 

 Viewing  all of these facts under the totality of the circumstances, Agent  Silva had reasonable suspicion to stop Cano to investigate the  possibility that he was engaged in alien  smuggling .  His decision to stop Cano was based on specific and articulable  facts and the rational inferences that can be drawn therefrom. See .  Because the Government has established reasonable suspicion by a  preponderance of the evidence, the Court need not consider the  Government's alternative argument that, once the results of Agent  Silva's search of the license plate on Cano's vehicle came    through revealing that the license plate was not registered to the  vehicle, Agent Silva would have had an independent basis to conduct  the investigatory stop. 


 V.  Conclusion and Recommendation 

 Having  considered Cano's motion, the response and reply thereto, the  Government's supplemental briefing, the testimony, evidence, and  argument presented at the hearing, and the governing law, the  undersigned recommends that Defendant's Motion to Suppress #38 be DENIED .
