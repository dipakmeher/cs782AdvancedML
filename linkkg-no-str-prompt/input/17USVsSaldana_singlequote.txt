 ORDER 

 BE  IT REMEMBERED on the 12th day of February 2015, the Court held a  hearing in the above-styled cause and the parties appeared in person  and through counsel. Before the Court are Defendant Federico  Saldana's Motion to Suppress #24, and the United States (the  Government)'s Response #28. Having reviewed the documents, the  evidence presented at the hearing, the arguments of counsel, and the  governing law, the Court now enters the following opinion and order  DENYING the motion. 


 Background 

 Three  law enforcement officials who participated in Saldana's stop and the  subsequent search of the truck and trailer he was driving on the day  in question testified at the hearing. Their testimony, along with  the Court's review of the patrol car video submitted as evidence at  the hearing, establishes the following facts: 

 On  November 24, 2014, Williamson County Sheriff's Office detectives  Gary Haston and Heather Vargas were traveling northbound on IH-35.  Haston,    a veteran narcotics investigator with 17 years of experience and who  has participated in hundreds of drug interdiction cases, was  teaching Vargas, a relative newcomer to the narcotics division, drug  interdiction techniques. At some point, their attention was drawn to  a 2008 Chevrolet truck pulling a flatbed trailer transporting a  scissor lift. In particular, Haston noticed the license plates for  both the truck and the trailer were newly registered. A records  check showed the trailer's license plate had been issued in Laredo  four days earlier on November 20, 2014, and the registered owner was  'Daniel Martin Huerta.' The truck's license plate had been  registered in San  Antonio on July 31, 2014, and its registered owner was 'Daniel A.  Huerta.' 

 Haston  testified to a number of other observations he made. He noticed the scissor lift had received a new paint job and  observed the battery charger area had a new over-coating of paint. See Def. Ex. 2. Haston also observed the truck was outfitted with what  he considered over-sized tires and after-market rims, which he found  atypical for trucks pulling a heavy piece of machinery. See Def. Ex. 1. Haston also testified that in his experience  large,    after-market rims are often used to hide loads of narcotics. Haston  further noted two pieces of steel had been placed under the wheels  of the scissor lift, which Haston interpreted to mean the scissor  lift would be on the trailer for a long time—consistent, according  to Haston, with drug trafficking. See Def. Ex. 2. 

 According  to Haston, the truck was traveling at approximately 75 miles per  hour, and it changed lanes multiple times in an unsafe manner.  Haston described the truck as both following vehicles at an unsafe  distance in the lane it occupied, and changing lanes into tight  spaces where the trailing car in the lane into which the truck had  just moved had to brake to avoid running into the back of the  trailer. Haston referenced two near-collisions he witnessed. Based  on these observations, Haston and Vargas contacted a patrol deputy  in a marked unit to conduct a traffic stop. 

 At  approximately 12:59 p.m., Deputy Jason Cox, responding to the  traffic violation information provided by Haston and Vargas, pulled  up behind the truck traveling in the far right    lane. See Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 1 at 12:59. Cox testified that he could not recall whether Haston relayed his  drug suspicions at this time, but Cox assumed the stop related to  drugs because he was familiar with Haston's work as a narcotics  investigator. The trailer at one point momentarily veered onto the  shoulder before returning inside the lane. Id .  at 12:59:21. Cox initiated a traffic stop on the shoulder of the  highway, and the driver stepped out of the vehicle, meeting Cox to  the right of the truck away from traffic. Mat 13:01:10. The driver  identified himself as Federico Saldana. Saldana indicated he was a  truck driver by trade but was not used to driving this sort of truck  with a trailer attached. When asked who the owner of the truck and  trailer were, Saldana was not able to easily recall the owner's name  but did indicate—although the audio is not entirely clear—the  owner's first name was 'Daniel.'  Id .  at 13:02:07. 

 A  few minutes after the stop, Haston and Vargas arrived on the scene.  Under questioning, Saldana told the officers he lived in Laredo and  was driving the scissor lift to Dallas for repairs as a favor to the  owner. Saldana stated he was being paid $300 for the job. Saldana  did not know the exact address in Dallas where he was to take the  trailer but claimed the plan was for him to call the owner upon  arrival in Dallas for the precise address. Approximately six minutes  after the stop, Cox informed Saldana he was going to give him a  warning based on the traffic violations and indicated he would need  the registration information for the vehicles to complete the  paperwork. Id .  at 13:06:10-45. Saldana stated he had identifying information for  the registered owner in the truck, and Saldana gave Cox consent to  retrieve    this information from inside the truck. Id .  at 13:06:42. Over the next few minutes, Haston continued to gather  information from Saldana while Cox looked for the registration  documents in the car. Haston inquired about Saldana's criminal  history, and Saldana confirmed he had been arrested multiple times,  including for the smuggling of illegal aliens and drugs. The drug  smuggling arrest occurred at a checkpoint in Laredo where Saldana  was found to have been transporting drugs in his 18-wheeler. In the  meantime, Cox had been unable to find the registration documents and  again asked Saldana where they were. Id .  at 13:11:58. Saldana again directed Cox to the cab of the truck and  gave Cox consent to retrieve those documents. Id . 

 As  Haston gathered more information, his suspicions of drug trafficking  heightened, and he told Saldana that based on what Saldana was  telling him, he believed there was dope somewhere on the truck or  trailer. Haston strongly encouraged Saldana to tell the officers if  there were any drugs. Haston told Saldana 'this is gonna be a  turning point in life for you, and it's gonna start right now.' Id .  at 13:13:09. Haston told Saldana 'we're gonna find the dope,  and your cooperation    is going to matter a lot.' Id .  at 13:13:30. Haston then informed Saldana he wanted to know two  things: (1) how much dope there was, and (2) where Saldana was  taking the drugs. Id .  at 13:13:37. Saldana responded: 'There ain't no dope.' Id .  at 13:13:50. Haston noted Saldana was evincing signs of nervousness  and reiterated 'it's going to be a lot less stressful for you  if you start cooperating from this point.' Id .  at 13:14:09. Haston cautioned Saldana that 'if there's a load  of dope, we're gonna find it.' Id .  at 13:14:15. Again, Haston asked 'how much is there? Cause you  know I know.' Id .  at 13:14:20. Saldana again responded: 'There's no dope.' Id .  at 13:14:25. Haston asked if there was cocaine or methamphetamine,  and Saldana said no. Id .  at 13:14:30. At this point, Haston asked 'Do you have any  objection if we search the truck or trailer?' Id .  at 13:14:38. Saldana said 'no.' Id .  at 13:14:40. Haston followed up: 'And we're not gonna find  anything? Cause I think we're gonna find it.' Id .  at 13:14:45. Haston gave Saldana another opportunity to cooperate,  telling him 'now is the time. Cause if you tell me it's not  here, and we find it? Then we're already off on the wrong foot, do  you understand?'     Id .  at 13:15:00. Saldana confirmed he understood, and Haston asked: 'Is  that the way we're gonna go?' Id .  at 13:15:07. Saldana said 'yes sir.' Id .  at 13:15:09. Haston clarified, 'so you don't have any problems  if we search the truck?' Id .  at 13:15:17. Saldana immediately responded: 'No problem.' Id .  at 13:15:20. 

 Haston  and Cox proceeded to make arrangements to have a K-9 unit meet them  to conduct a search. Over the next few minutes, Haston and Vargas  started searching in and around the trailer and truck. Haston  reapproached Saldana and informed him they were bringing in a dog  for a search. Haston also asked Saldana again about his criminal  history and learned Saldana served 9 years in federal prison.  Saldana also claimed he completed probation 3 years prior. 

 After  more questions, the officers had Saldana drive the truck and trailer  a few hundred yards to a rest area where it would be safer to  conduct the search. Id .  at 13:30:01-32:15. The officers continued searching the truck and  trailer themselves as they awaited the K-9 unit, which arrived  roughly ten minutes later. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 2 at 13:41:25. The K-9  handler, Josiah Bennett, testified he understood from the officers  that Saldana had    given consent to search, and he therefore proceeded to have the dog  search the trailer and the bed of the truck. Bennett next had the  dog enter the cab of the truck through the front and rear doors on  the driver side from approximately 1:45:55 to 1:46:45. Id .  at 13:45:55-46:45. Bennett took the dog back to the trailer and the  bed of the truck again before taking the dog to the passenger side  of the truck. While the view is mostly obstructed, Bennett seemed to  have the dog enter the truck through the front and rear doors on the  passenger side from approximately 1:49:55 to 1:51:00. Id .  at 13:49:55-51:00. Bennett then put the dog back in his patrol car. 

 Although  not apparent from the video, according to Bennett's testimony, the  dog alerted twice to the presence of narcotics. The first alert was  to a set of tools on the floorboard of the front seat on the  passenger side. The second alert was to clothes on the floorboard of  the back seat on the passenger side. Comparing this testimony to the  video, the Court concludes these alerts occurred, at the latest, by  1:51:00. 

 After  Bennett put the dog away, the officers continued searching the truck  and trailer themselves looking for drugs. Bennett    used the dog again to search the trailer and the bed of the truck  before returning the dog to the patrol car. Id .  at 14:03:45-l 0:00. For approximately the next half hour, the  officers continued examining the truck and trailer. Their attention  increasingly focused on the scissor lift. Id .  at 14:37:00. The officers made arrangements to transport the truck  and trailer to a tire shop for further investigation. They informed  Saldana of the plan, and he began driving the truck and trailer  himself to the tire shop. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 3 at 14:46:35. The video  evidence ends with Saldana still driving over twenty minutes later. 

 Sometime  thereafter, the parties arrived at the tire shop where the officers  checked the depth of the batteries to the scissor lift. After  dismantling four batteries, the officers retrieved twenty four  bundles of a compressed white powder that field-tested positive for  cocaine. Saldana was then placed under arrest. At no point after  Saldana gave Haston consent to search the truck and trailer did  Saldana revoke his consent. 


 Analysis 

 Saldana  has moved to suppress the cocaine under his rights, arguing there was no reasonable suspicion to stop Saldana in  the first place, and    contending there was no probable cause for the detention and  subsequent search of the truck and trailer. The protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures;  traffic stops are considered seizures within the meaning of the . ; .  Because traffic stops are considered more similar to investigative  detentions than formal arrests, courts analyze the legality of  traffic stops for purposes under the standard articulated in . .  This standard is a two-tiered reasonable suspicion inquiry: (1)  whether the officer's actions were justified at the stop's  inception; and (2) whether the search or seizure was reasonably  related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop in the  first place. ; .  In addition, 'the investigative methods employed should be the  least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the  officer's suspicion in a short period of time.' .  Once an officer's suspicions have been verified or dispelled, the  detention must end unless there is additional articulable reasonable  suspicion, but 'at that point, continuation of the detention  is no longer supported by the facts that justified its initiation.' .  Reasonable suspicion exists when the detaining    officer 'can point to specific and articulable facts which,  taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably  warrant the search and seizure.' (internal quotation omitted). 


 I.  First Prong of the Terry Test: Reasonable suspicion existed for the traffic stop 

 Saldana  first disputes the basis for the traffic stop, relying on the fact  Saldana did not commit any traffic violations in the presence of  Cox, the officer who pulled him over. 'For a traffic stop to be  justified at its inception, an officer must have an objectively  reasonable suspicion that some sort of illegal activity, such as a  traffic violation, occurred, or is about to occur, before stopping  the vehicle.' .  The Supreme Court has stated that in making a reasonable suspicion  inquiry, a court 'must look at the totality of the  circumstances of each case to see whether the detaining officer has  a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal  wrongdoing.' (internal quotations omitted). Reasonable suspicion can vest through  the collective knowledge of the officers in a search and seizure  operation. ,  .  The collective knowledge theory for reasonable suspicion applies so  long as there is    'some degree of communication' between the acting officer  and the officer who has knowledge of the necessary facts. . 

 Here,  Haston testified he observed Saldana having trouble maintaining his  vehicle and the attached trailer carrying a piece of heavy machinery  in a single lane, and that Saldana was changing lanes in an unsafe  manner resulting in two near-collisions. Haston directly relayed this information to Cox, and Cox proceeded  to locate Saldana and conduct a traffic stop. Therefore, Cox had an  objectively reasonable suspicion Saldana had committed multiple  traffic violations as witnessed by Haston and Vargas. In addition,  Cox, upon locating Saldana's truck and trailer, witnessed the  trailer veering onto the shoulder before he initiated the stop. 


 II.  Second Prong of the Terry Test: The seizure was reasonably related in scope to the  circumstances that justified the stop 

 Saldana  also contends the officers' prolonged detention of him  exceeded    the scope of the reason for the traffic stop. Generally, the  'detention must be temporary and last no longer than is  necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop . . . .' .  In the course of effectuating the stop, a police officer may  permissibly examine the driver's license and registration and run a  computer check on them to investigate whether the driver has any  outstanding warrants and if the vehicle is stolen. .  An officer may also ask the driver about the purpose and itinerary  of his trip. .  Indeed, the officer's questions need not even be related to the  purpose of the traffic stop, since 'detention, not  questioning, is the evil at which Terry's second prong is aimed.' . 

 Although  an officer's inquiry may be wide-ranging, once all relevant computer  checks have come back clean, there is no more reasonable suspicion,  and, as a general matter, continued questioning thereafter  unconstitutionally prolongs the detention. ; see  also ; .  A recognized exception to this rule is that if additional reasonable  suspicion arises in the course of the stop and before the initial  purpose of the stop has been fulfilled, then the detention may  continue until the new reasonable suspicion has    been dispelled or confirmed. See ; . 

 In  this case, Saldana came to a stop on the shoulder at approximately  1:01:10. Haston spent the first five minutes after the stop asking  Saldana reasonable questions about ownership of the truck and  trailer and the nature of Saldana's trip. While Cox attempted to  locate the registration papers indicating ownership of the truck and  trailer, Haston initiated his own line of questioning. At 1:14:40,  Saldana said he had no objection to the officers searching his truck  and trailer and confirmed at 1:15:20 he had no problems with the  search. Put differently, less than fifteen minutes into the  stop—when Cox had yet to locate the registration papers which  would allow him to complete any traffic violation or warning  paperwork—Saldana had already given the officers his unequivocal  consent to search the truck and trailer. At 1:17:20, Cox clarified  to Saldana he could not find the paperwork in the truck as Saldana  had indicated. Gov't Ex. 1, Clip 1 at 13:17:20. 

 Considering  these circumstances, the detention did not exceed its original  scope. In a valid traffic stop, an officer can request a driver's  license, insurance papers, vehicle registration, run computer    checks thereon, and issue a citation or warning. See .  Haston's questioning occurred while Cox was still in the process of  gathering the relevant information to complete the warning paperwork  and therefore did not extend the initial valid seizure beyond a  reasonable duration. In other words, as of the time Saldana gave his  consent, the detention continued to be supported by the facts that  justified the traffic stop. 

 Moreover,  in the alternative, Haston's suspicions regarding potential drug  trafficking were ever-increasing as the first fifteen minutes of the  stop unfolded. Indeed, Haston's suspicions began before he saw  Saldana committing multiple traffic violations. Haston noticed the  recently registered license plates and ran checks on them,  discovering the trailer's license plate had been registered in  Laredo four days earlier to Daniel Martin Huerta while the truck's  license plate had been registered four months earlier in San  Antonio to Daniel A. Huerta. Haston observed the erratic driving consistent  with an individual perhaps unfamiliar with driving this sort of  truck and trailer combination. Haston noted the oversized tires and  after-market rims, which he considered unusual for    this type of machinery hauling. Haston observed a new paint job for  the scissor lift and the battery charger area as well as corrugated  metal plates under the tires of the scissor left. All of these  factors continued to build Haston's suspicions there might be a load  of narcotics hidden in the truck or the trailer. Haston's suspicions  only continued to grow as he questioned Saldana about his trip.  Troubling statements from Saldana included: (1) he was not the owner  of the truck or trailer; (2) he had trouble recalling the owner's  name; (3) he was driving a heavy piece of machinery over 400 miles  from Laredo to Dallas for repairs; (4) he did not know the exact  address of his ultimate destination in Dallas; (5) he was supposed  to call the owner upon arrival in Dallas to find out the actual  address; (6) he was hauling the scissor lift as a favor to the owner  and apparently for $300; (7) he was not used to driving a truck and  trailer combination; and (8) he did not know the name of the owner's  painting company. 

 As  a narcotics investigator with 17 years of experience, including  hundreds of interdiction cases, Haston strongly suspected Saldana  was transporting a load of dope and started inquiring    into Saldana's criminal history. Haston learned Saldana had  previously smuggled  aliens and drugs using his 18-wheeler. Haston told Saldana that he  suspected Saldana was again transporting drugs. Haston urged Saldana  to cooperate and directly asked if he were moving drugs, which  Saldana denied. Haston responded by asking if Saldana objected to or  had any problem with the officers searching his truck and trailer,  and Saldana stated he had no objection and no problem. Taken  together, from the time Cox stopped Saldana for the traffic  violations to the point where Saldana gave his consent to search,  additional reasonable suspicion arose for Haston both through his  observations and conversations. Haston had yet to either dispel or  confirm these accumulating suspicions as of that time, and he could  validly prolong the detention in order to address these concerns. 


 III.  The Consent was Voluntary and Never Revoked 

 The  Government argues Saldana gave his consent to Haston to search the  truck and trailer, and he never revoked that consent at any time.  Therefore, according to the Government, none of the events after the  moment of consent implicate the .  'To be valid, consent to search must be free    and voluntary.' .  The government has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the  evidence, that the consent was voluntary.  .  The voluntariness of consent is 'a question of fact to be  determined from the totality of all the circumstances.' .  The appropriate inquiry in determining the voluntariness of a  consent is whether a reasonable person in the subject's position  would have felt free to decline the officer's request. .  In evaluating the voluntariness of consent, courts consider six  factors: 

 (1)  the voluntariness of the defendant's custodial status; (2) the  presence of coercive police procedures; (3) the extent and level of  the defendant's cooperation with the police; (4) the defendant's  awareness of his right to refuse to consent; (5) the defendant's  education and intelligence; and (6) the defendant's belief that no  incriminating evidence will be found. 

 (citations omitted). All six factors are relevant, but no single one  is dispositive or controlling. Id . 

 In  the current situation, the first factor weighs against the  Government as the officers had temporarily detained Saldana for the  purpose of a traffic violation in addition to dispelling or  confirming their increasing suspicions    of drug trafficking as the situation evolved. 

 As  for the second factor, there is minimal indication of coercive  police procedures. The stop began as a routine traffic encounter.  Cox and Saldana engaged in a cooperative, polite conversation  regarding Saldana's traffic violations, the ownership of the truck  and trailer, and the itinerary of Saldana's trip. Haston also asked  Saldana many questions, and Saldana was ready and willing to answer  all of them. Haston's manner certainly became more aggressive as his  suspicions grew, but his conduct did not amount to coercion. Haston  openly informed Saldana of his belief as to the presence of  narcotics, and Haston applied some pressure in attempting to elicit  Saldana's cooperation. For instance, Haston made the following  statements: 'this is gonna be a turning point in life for you,  and it's gonna start right now'; 'we're gonna find the  dope, and your cooperation is going to matter a lot'; 'it's  going to be a lot less stressful for you if you start cooperating  from this point'; 'if there's a load of dope, we're gonna  find it'; and 'how much is there? Cause you know I know.'  While Saldana showed signs of nervousness, he continued to answer  the    questions and persisted in denying the presence of any drugs. 

 Ultimately,  Haston asked: 'Do you have any objection if we search the truck  or trailer?' Saldana responded he did not. Forty seconds later,  Haston again confirmed: 'So you don't have any problems if we  search the truck?' Saldana said he had no problem. While Haston  did not specifically tell Saldana he had a right to refuse his  search request, both of Haston's questions indicated Saldana could  either object to, or express a problem with, a search. See (finding it is 'particularly worth noting' that the police  specifically advised the subject he had a right to refuse consent to  search his luggage). Saldana, with no hesitation or seeming concern,  gave the officers his consent to look for drugs in the truck and the  trailer. There is no indication in the record that Saldana ever  expressed concern or confusion over his consent. Instead, Saldana  remained cooperative throughout the process, including driving the  truck and trailer to the rest stop for the dog search and further  driving the truck and trailer to the tire shop for more thorough  searching. It cannot be said Saldana merely submitted to  overpowering authority. See (noting    orderly submission to law enforcement who falsely represented to  defendant they had authority to conduct search pursuant to a warrant  was not valid consent); (concluding that in circumstances involving a 17-year-old boy  awakened in his bedroom at 3:00 a.m. by police officers who told him  'we need to go and talk,' his response of 'okay'  was not regarded as consent but a 'mere submission to  authority'). In sum, Saldana's consent was not the product of  coercion. 

 Moving  on to the third factor, Saldana was quite cooperative as he answered  the officers' questions and caused them no problems. For the fourth  factor, there is no indication in the record Saldana was aware of  his right to refuse consent. Yet while officers are not required to  explicitly inform defendants of the right to refuse consent, the  wording of both of Haston' s questions regarding consent gave  Saldana a clear opportunity to either object to or state a problem  with a search. Moreover, Saldana is a previously convicted felon  experienced with the criminal justice system, including having  served at least 9 years in federal prison, which makes it more  likely he is aware of his legal rights. Regarding the fifth factor,  there    is no evidence in the record demonstrating Saldana's level of  education. His conversations and interactions with the officers do  suggest he is an individual of reasonable intelligence. Finally,  with respect to the sixth factor, Saldana did not testify, so it is  difficult to know what his belief was concerning whether any drugs  would be found. He did repeatedly deny there were any drugs. He also  was very quick to give his consent to search, suggesting he believed  the officers would not find any drugs. 

 Taking  all six of the factors into consideration, the Court concludes the  consent was voluntary and valid, and Saldana never revoked his  consent even as the officers increased the intrusiveness of the  search. Therefore, the does not apply to the events occurring after Saldana's voluntary  consent. 


 Conclusion 

 Cox  had reasonable suspicion Saldana had committed a traffic violation  when he initiated the stop. Within fifteen minutes—and before Cox  had completed the initial purpose of the stop by issuing the warning  citation—Saldana had voluntarily consented to a search of the  truck and trailer. Moreover, Cox and Haston developed additional  reasonable suspicion of potential drug trafficking through    their observations and conversations with Saldana, and they had yet  to dispel or confirm these suspicions as of the time Saldana gave  his valid consent. As such, the officers were justified in  prolonging the stop during those initial fifteen minutes and through  the moment of consent. Saldana never revoked his consent, and the  officers ultimately discovered the secreted cocaine. Saldana's rights were not violated, and therefore his motion to suppress the  drugs and his statements to law enforcement after the discovery of  the drugs must be denied. 

 Accordingly,  IT IS ORDERED that Defendant Federico Saldana's Motion to Suppress  #24 is DENIED. 

 SIGNED  this the 27th day of February 2015.

 E nd  of Document   

 1  The  record is not entirely clear whether Haston made the observations  described in this paragraph before or after the traffic stop.   

 2  The  Government submitted as Exhibit 1 Deputy Cox's patrol video in the  form of a DVD containing three separate but consecutive clips of the  events in question. The DVD references time on a 24-hour clock. For  citations, the Court uses the 24-hour notation. When describing the  timing    of events, however, the Court will use the 12-hour clock notation.   

 3  The  Government contends Saldana initially offered the name 'Miguel'  as the owner before later admitting the owner's true name is  'Daniel.' After carefully listening to the audio, the  Court concludes, at a minimum, Saldana did not say 'Miguel.'  The Court further concludes that Saldana likely said the name  'Daniel.'   

 4  provides that 'an operator on a roadway divided into two or  more clearly marked lanes for traffic: (1) shall drive as nearly as  practical entirely within a single lane; and (2) may not move from  the lane unless that movement can be made safely.' .
