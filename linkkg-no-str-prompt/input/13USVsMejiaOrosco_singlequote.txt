     CLARK, Chief Judge:  

 Juventino  Mejia-Orosco was convicted of illegally transporting aliens into the  United States in violation of .  He does not contest the underlying conviction, but argues that the  district court imposed an improper sentence. Because the district  court correctly applied the guidelines to its factual findings, and  because those findings were not clearly erroneous, we affirm.  

 I.  

 Mejia-Orosco  is a citizen of Guatemala. He earns his living trucking curios from  Guatemala, through Mexico, to the United States. In April of 1988,  on one of his many trips to this country, he brought along Hector  Galvencio Paz-Ortega and Carlos    Enrique Cruz-Morales, both citizens of Guatemala and purportedly  related to Mejia-Orosco. After Mejia-Orosco and his two passengers  had travelled through Mexico and arrived in Nuevo Laredo,  Tamaulipas, Mexico, Paz-Ortega and Cruz-Morales disembarked.  

 Mejia-Orosco  drove his van across the bridge into Laredo , Texas .  Paz-Ortega and Cruz-Morales waded the Rio Grande. They did not pass  through customs and had no legal right to enter this country.  Mejia-Orosco and the aliens then regrouped and spent two days in  Laredo. During this time, the group contacted relatives of the  aliens living in the United States. The family members were  instructed to wire Mejia-Orosco funds. He received $ 1,000 from  Paz-Ortega's family in Los Angeles and $ 1,700 from relatives of  Cruz-Morales living in New York City. Two days after arriving, the  three drove to the Laredo International Airport. Mejia-Orosco  supplied the aliens with airline tickets to San  Antonio and the key to a motel room there. Later, Mejia-Orosco met the  aliens at the motel and drove them to the San  Antonio International Airport. At the airport, Paz-Ortega was detained and  questioned by immigration officials. He admitted that he and  Cruz-Morales    had illegally entered the United States with the aid of  Mejia-Orosco. With this information, law enforcement officials were  able to locate and detain Cruz-Morales, who was aboard an airplane  awaiting departure to New York, and Mejia-Orosco. A search of  Mejia-Orosco's van uncovered 4,102 United States dollars and 574,000  Mexican pesos.  

 Mejia-Orosco  pled guilty to one count of illegally transporting aliens into the  United States. He admits that he received $ 850 from each of the  transported aliens in exchange for his illegal services. He was  sentenced to 10 months in prison and fined $ 4,000. His van, used to  transport the aliens from Guatemala, has been seized pending  forfeiture proceedings.  

 The  district court calculated the sentence imposed on Mejia-Orosco  according to the guidelines promulgated by the United States  Sentencing Commission. See  .  On appeal, Mejia-Orosco argues that the district court erroneously  imposed a sentence of 10 months imprisonment. The guidelines, in the  defendant's view, would permit a maximum sentence of no more than 7  months. His appeal is specifically authorized by statute.     .  

 II  

 Our  review of the sentence imposed by the district court is governed by  and :  

 (d)  Consideration.--Upon review of the record, the court of appeals  shall determine whether the sentence--  

 (1)  was imposed in violation of law;  

 (2)  was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the  sentencing guidelines;  

 (3)  is outside the range of the applicable sentencing guideline, and is  unreasonable, having regard for--  

 (A)  the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence, as set forth in  chapter 227 of this title; and  

     (B) the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence, as  stated by the district court pursuant to the provisions of ;  or 

 (4)  was imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable  sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable. 

 The  court of appeals shall give due regard to the opportunity of the  district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and shall  accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are  clearly erroneous.  

 (e)  Decision and disposition  

 If  the court of appeals determines that    the sentence--  

 (1)  was imposed in violation of law or imposed as a result of an  incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines, the court shall  remand the case for further sentencing proceedings with such  instructions as the court considers appropriate;  

 (2)  is outside the range of the applicable sentencing guideline and is  unreasonable or was imposed for an offense for which there is no  applicable sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable, it  shall state specific reasons for the conclusions and . . . 

 it  shall set aside the sentence and remand the case for further  sentencing proceedings with such instructions as the court considers  appropriate.  

 (3)  is not described in paragraph (1) or (2), it shall affirm the  sentence. 

 Under  these provisions, the characterization of the alleged sentencing  error is critical. A sentence imposed 'outside the range of the  applicable sentencing guideline' will be reversed only if it is  unreasonable. .  On the other hand, a sentence 'imposed as a result of an  incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines' must be  reversed even if reasonable.     .   Findings of fact that underlie the district court's sentence are  reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard. .  

 The  sentencing guidelines do not merely change the procedures used to  impose sentences, they initiate an historic shift in modern  penology. The guidelines are designed to create uniform, determinate  sentences based upon the crime committed, not the offender. Congress  abandoned the rehabilitation model that shaped penology in the  Twentieth Century. Under the rehabilitation model, sentences were  individualized. Prisoners were sentenced according to predictions of  'their potential for, or actual rehabilitation.' .  From this premise, the maxim developed that 'the punishment  should fit the offender and not merely the crime.' .  Congress concluded after decades of empirical evidence that this  commendable and ambitious approach had proven unworkable and unjust.  Predictions of an offender's propensity for, or actual,  rehabilitation    were found to be unsubstantiated and, in fact, incapable of any  scientific determination. The result was that an unjustifiably wide  range of punishment was meted out to similar offenders convicted of  committing similar crimes under like circumstances. In most cases,  the district court would impose a term of imprisonment that was  almost never fully implemented. Instead, prisoners were released  based upon the determination of parole officials that the prisoner  was rehabilitated.  

 By  enacting the sentencing guidelines Congress returned federal  sentencing to an earlier philosophy that the punishment should fit  the crime and that the main purpose of imprisonment is punishment.  Senator Edward M. Kennedy described the guidelines as 'a  comprehensive and far reaching new approach . . . designed to  reduce the unacceptable disparity of punishment that plagues the  federal system, and . . . to assure sentences that are fair--and are  perceived to be fair--to offenders, victims, and society.' 32  Fed.B. News & J. 60, 65 (1985). Similar crimes should be  punished similarly. To accomplish this goal, Congress limited the  discretion of district judges through the guidelines and    made the    sentence imposed determinate by abolishing parole. The guidelines  provide the analytic framework needed to create uniform sentences.  The accompanying abolishment of parole ensures that the imposed  sentence will be served.  

 Sentencing  under the guidelines is not, however, an exact science. Justice  cannot be meted out according to mathematical formulas. The universe  of potential factors that might affect the seriousness of a given  offense is too broad to be refined to a mechanistic approach. The  sentencing guidelines are not intended to cover all contingencies or  rigidly bind district judges. The guidelines do not impose the  sentence, they provide a framework for a district court to impose a  sentence. 'The sentencing judge has an obligation to consider  all the relevant factors in a case and to impose a sentence outside  the guidelines in an appropriate case. The purpose of the sentencing  guidelines is to provide a structure for evaluating the fairness and  appropriateness of the sentence for an individual offender, not to  eliminate the thoughtful imposition of individualized sentences.'  S.Rep. No. 225, reprinted  in 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.News 3182, 3235.  

 The  district court's    fact-finding power is an important guarantor of the practical  judgment essential to any just sentencing procedure. As we have  already mentioned, the guidelines statute expressly insulates such  fact-finding against appellate attack. (endorsing the 'clearly erroneous' standard).   Once the district court has made factual findings, the court's  sentence will be affirmed if it results from a proper application of  the sentencing guidelines to those facts. On the other hand, if the  court applies the guidelines to the found facts and then departs  from the resulting sentencing range, the court must offer acceptable  reasons for its departure: a departure is subject to reversal unless  it is 'reasonable.' .  

 III  

   Sentencing under the Commission's guidelines is based upon two  factors--the offense and the defendant's criminal history. The  statute under which the defendant was convicted determines a base  offense level. This base level is then adjusted upward or lower by  specified offense characteristics. For example, robbery has a base  offense level of 18. This base level is increased incrementally if  the amount    taken in the robbery totals more than $ 2,500. The level is also  increased if a firearm is used, more if the firearm is brandished,  even more if discharged. Any bodily injury resulting from the crime  also increases the offense level. Cooperation with government  officials, on the other hand, decreases the offense level. The  defendant's criminal history category is calculated independently  from the offense level and its incremental adjustments. One of six  different categories is assigned the defendant based upon a point  scale. Points are assigned to prior convictions depending upon the  length of sentence and whether the instant offense was committed  within two years of release from prison or while under any criminal  sentence.  

 The  final sentencing range is calculated from a table by  cross-referencing the offense level with the defendant's criminal  history category. The table sets sentencing ranges in which the  maximum sentence exceeds the minimum by the greater of 6 months or  25%. This allows the district court some latitude to fine tune the  sentence to the individual defendant and the circumstances of the  defendant's offense.   The district court may depart from the guideline-specified    sentence when it finds 'an aggravating or mitigating  circumstance . . . that was not adequately taken into consideration  by the Sentencing Commission. . . .' .  This discretion is narrowed by lists of those circumstances taken  into consideration and those that do not justify a departure. See Guidelines at 5.25-5.34.  

   The district court calculates the offense level and the criminal  history category from the information contained in the pre-sentence  report. Departures from the guidelines will also generally be  justified from the information contained in this report. The  accuracy of the presentence report,    therefore, is critical to proper application of the sentencing  guidelines, and strict compliance with the rules of criminal  procedure governing this report is warranted. . .  

 In  today's case, Mejia-Orosco does not challenge the information  contained in the report. Rather, he contends that the evidence  recited by the report does not justify the sentence imposed.  Mejia-Orosco pled guilty to one count of illegally transporting an  alien in violation of     .  The base offense level for such a violation is 9. .  Mejia-Orosco received a two-level reduction in this offense level  for accepting responsibility for his offense. .  He had a criminal history category of I, the lowest category. With  these factors, the sentencing table sets a range of 1-7 months  imprisonment. The imposed sentence of 10 months is thus, in the  defendant's view, three months too long.  

 The  district court, however, found that an offense level of 7 did not  accurately reflect the nature of the crime committed. The court gave  alternative justifications for raising the offense level to 9, which  authorizes the stiffer 10-month sentence. First, the district court  determined that Mejia-Orosco played an aggravating role in the  offense; that is, he was an organizer, leader, or supervisor. Such a  role in any criminal activity involving 2-5 participants warrants a  2-level increase in the offense level. .  

 The  district court also justified the 2-level increase by reference to of the guidelines, which requires a 2-level increase in the offense  level if 'the defendant previously has been convicted of  smuggling,    transporting, or harboring an unlawful alien, or related offense. .  . .' The district court classed a previous conviction for  unlawful entry as a 'related offense' because Mejia-Orosco  was originally charged with transporting four illegal aliens,  although he eventually pled guilty to a reduced charge of illegal  entry. It is unclear whether the district court intended to apply  2L1.1(b)(2) directly, or to use it as the basis for a departure from  the guidelines. See §§ 4A1.3, 5K2.0. Mejia-Orosco argues on appeal that the district  court misapplied the guidelines when it made these determinations  and that this misapplication requires reversal of his sentence.  Because we affirm based upon the court's first justification for the  two-level increase, we do not reach the second.  

   An offender plays an aggravating role in the offense if the  defendant 'was an organizer, leader, manager or supervisor.' .  If the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity  involving five or more participants, the offense level is increased  by four levels. If there are less than five participants, the  offense level increases two levels. The introductory statement to  this part of    the guidelines clearly indicates that there must be more than one  participant involved in the criminal activity for this section to  apply. However, the guideline makes clear, through its explanation  of the term 'otherwise extensive,' that managerial status  may attach by the orchestration of unwitting or duped participants,  as well as through the leadership of criminally responsible  participants. Although the government does not contend that  Mejia-Orosco controlled a sufficient number of people to make his  organization 'otherwise extensive' within the meaning of or ,  he might have exercised enough control over unwitting participants  to make him a manager within the meaning of .  Finally, 'for the purposes of ,  the aliens  smuggled ,  transported, or harbored are not considered participants unless they  actively assisted in the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of  others.' Commentary to .  

 The  district court found that Mejia-Orosco was 'an organizer,  leader, manager, or supervisor.' To decide Mejia-Orosco's  appeal of this finding, we must first determine whether the finding  was factual or legal. We hold that it was factual. The  determination    of manager status demands that the trial judge draw an inference  from a variety of data, including the information in the  pre-sentence report and the defendant's statements and demeanor at  the sentencing    hearing. Of course, the fact of manager status may be more difficult  to ascertain than purely physical facts--such as whether the  defendant carried a gun during commission of the crime--and may  depend upon an assessment of the broad context of the crime. But a  complex fact is no less a fact.  

 The  Supreme Court has recognized that   findings which require both assessment of complex evidence as well  as sensitivity to legal purposes may nevertheless be factual. The  Court has held that whether cause exists to dismiss a venireman is a  factual question. .  'Cause' is obviously a complex thing to perceive, but, for  purposes of appellate review, it is factual nonetheless. On the  civil side, the Court has held that the existence of discrimination  is a question of fact. .  Indeed,    in criminal cases under the Continuing Criminal Enterprise statute, ,  the defendant's status as a 'manager'--precisely the issue  raised by Mejia-Orosco--is a question of fact for the jury. See  e.g., (terms 'managed,' 'supervised,' and 'organized'  are to be interpreted according to their ordinary, lay meaning).  

  is not the only guideline provision calling upon district judges to  make sophisticated factual determinations. Sections 3B1.2 (requiring  the judge to decide whether the defendant was a 'minimal  participant' or 'minor participant') and 3B1.3  (requiring the judge to decide, among other things, whether the  defendant used a 'special skill') demand comparable  findings. Judicial fact-finding upon these matters will, like  determinations of manager status, enjoy the protection of the  'clearly erroneous' standard.  

 A  more exacting approach to appellate review of sentences would  frustrate the purpose of the guidelines. As we have already noted,  the sentencing commission sought to ensure that district courts  would continue to take into account 'all the    relevant factors in a case.' Indeed, a cramped construction of  the district court's fact-finding power would have a perverse  consequence: the standard of review for departures from the  guidelines would be more deferential than the standard of review for  applications of the guidelines. This disparity would arise because  permits appellate modification to a sentence outside the range of  the guidelines only if the sentence is not 'reasonable.'  If factual findings were narrowly construed, and legal issues  commensurately expanded, actual applications of the guidelines would  be subject to review for legal error. District courts would have an  incentive to insure against appellate reversal by footing their  sentencing decisions on reasonable departures. Such a result would  clearly undermine the purpose of the sentencing guidelines.  

 The  standard of review which we establish today avoids this odd result.  We   will affirm sentences imposed by district judges who make factual  findings that are not clearly erroneous, and who apply the  guidelines to those findings. In such cases, the sentencing judge  need not offer further reasons justifying the sentence.    When, however, the judge departs from the guideline range, an  additional reasonableness requirement applies: the judge must offer  reasons explaining why the departure is justified in terms of the  policies underlying the sentencing guidelines. See  .  

 Implicit  in what we have said is the conclusion that   the district court's simple statement that the defendant is a  'manager' or 'leader' is a finding of fact.  Building on the lesson of ,  we 'decline to require the judge to write out' more  specific findings about the defendant. We recognize that so formal a  requirement would interfere with the smooth operation of the  sentencing hearing. In some instances, what is necessarily a  'judgment call' may not be susceptible of  particularization. Nonetheless, we urge district courts to clarify  their ultimate factual findings by more specific findings when  possible. Specific findings will both    guide reviewing courts to the evidentiary basis for sentencing  judgments, and also help the trial judge to identify matters  relevant to application of the guidelines.  

 Application  of the 'clearly    erroneous' standard to Mejia-Orosco's case is easy. The  district judge concluded that the defendant was a manager,  supervisor, organizer, or leader of a criminal activity. The  undisputed evidence that relatives of the aliens were involved in  the crime provides sufficient support for this factual finding. The  relatives either knew that they were aiding a criminal enterprise,  in which case they were criminally responsible participants, or they  were duped into aiding the enterprise, in which case they were  unwitting participants. In either case, the enterprise was extensive  within the meaning of .  We therefore see no reason to disturb the factual findings of the  district judge.  

 The  judgment and sentence of the district court is  

 AFFIRMED.
