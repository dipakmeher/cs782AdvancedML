 REPORT  & RECOMMENDATION 

 Defendant  RICARDO SOTO, who has been charged with one count of transporting an  undocumented alien within the United States (in violation of ),  has filed a Motion to Suppress (Dkt. No. 33). At issue is whether  United States Border Patrol agents on roving patrol had reasonable  suspicion to conduct an investigatory    stop of the vehicle in which Defendant was riding as a front-seat  passenger. Defendant prays, pursuant to the fruit of the poisonous  tree doctrine, for the suppression of any evidence discovered as a  result of his detention, which would include the undocumented alien  allegedly being transported in the backseat of the vehicle. 

 After  the Government filed a response to Defendant's Motion (Dkt. No. 39),  this matter was then referred to the undersigned Magistrate Judge  (Dkt. No. 41). A Suppression Hearing was held before the undersigned  on September 11, 2009. Defendant, who is currently in custody, was  present and represented by counsel. At the hearing, the Court took  the testimony of three witnesses, two for the Government and one for  the Defense. 

 First,  the Government called Border Patrol Agent Victor M. Barberena  ('Agent Barberena'), who graduated from the CBP Border  Patrol Academy in Artesia, New Mexico this past April after having  completed a four-month long basic training program. Agent Barberena  is also a 15-year veteran of the Laredo Police Department. He began  his tenure with the LPD as a patrolman and served in this capacity  for five years. He was then assigned to the LPD Special    Investigations Unit as a detective. Just prior to joining Border  Patrol, Agent Barberena served as a sergeant in the Internal Affairs  Division of the LPD. As a Border Patrol agent, Agent Barberena has  been assigned the entire time to the Cotulla Area, which covers a  roughly 60-mile stretch along Interstate Highway 35 ('I-35'),  from Encinal to Liddell, Texas. Agent Barberena testified to  conducting the roving patrol stop of the vehicle in which Defendant  was riding. 

 Next,  the Government called Border Patrol Agent Abraham Esqueda ('Agent  Esqueda'), who attended and graduated from the Border Patrol  Academy with Agent Barberena. Agent Esqueda was on roving patrol with Agent Barberena when they  conducted the stop at issue. He testified to the same. 

 Finally,  the Defense called Juan Carlos Delacruz Jaramillo ('Delacruz'),  the undocumented alien allegedly transported by Defendant. Delacruz  is currently being detained as a material witness. ( See Dkt. Nos. 2, 6.) Defendant did not testify at the Suppression  Hearing. 

 Having  considered the matter, the Magistrate Judge RECOMMENDS that the  District Judge, after his independent review of the record, DENY  Defendant RICARDO SOTO's Motion to Suppress (Dkt.    No. 33). 


 Suppression  Hearing Testimony 

 Based  on the testimony elicited at the Suppression Hearing, the Court is  left with two different versions of the events that led up the  roving patrol stop in question: one by the two Border Patrol agents  who conducted the stop, and the other by Delacruz, the undocumented  alien in transport. For ease of reference, the Court will present  these reports separately. At the outset, however, the Court notes  that the Court finds credible and thus adopts as its factual  findings that account presented by the Border Patrol agents. 

 I. Border  Patrol Agents' Testimony 

 In  the early morning of June 11, 2009, while on roving patrol, Agents  Barberena and Esqueda positioned their marked Chevy Tahoe on the  east side of I-35 near the end of the limited access, designated  rest area at the 59 mile marker (the 'Rest Area') between  Laredo and San  Antonio ,  Texas and began monitoring northbound traffic. Border Patrol  commonly uses this precise 'sitting' point for the  tactical advantage it provides in detecting illegal activity. Just  south of this point, running parallel along the east side of I-35,  is a line of bushes. This serves to conceal a Border Patrol unit  sitting near    the end of the Rest Area from the view of a northbound vehicle until  such vehicle may pass the bush-line's edge. 

 At  approximately 8:00 a.m., the Agents observed as a blue Nissan Maxima  drove past the bushes and into full view. The front, passenger-side window was completely rolled down. A man,  later determined to be Defendant Soto, occupied the front passenger  seat. According to the Agents, the rear-cabin windows were also  rolled down, but only about halfway. A man, later determined to be  Delacruz, occupied the backseat on the passenger's side. This  occupant's behavior is what attracted the Agents' attention. When  the Maxima drove out past the bushes, the backseat passenger turned  and looked towards the patrol unit, and his eyes opened wide in what  seemed to the Agents to be an expression of 'surprise.'  The man then allegedly slouched back into his seat and out of sight  behind the car's c-pillar (or vertical frame) and below the  horizontal level of the halfway-down windowpane, which was heavily  tinted. It appeared to the Agents as if the backseat passenger was  trying to conceal himself. 

 Based  on this behavior, the Agents decided to investigate further. Agent  Barberena, the driver of    the patrol unit, pulled onto I-35 and headed northward. Within about  one minute, the Agents caught up to the Maxima and discerned that  its back window was also heavily tinted. Agent Barberena tailed  behind while Agent Esqueda, who rode in the front passenger seat of  the patrol unit, ran a license plate registration check. The return  indicated the vehicle was registered in Kingsville, Texas. The  Agents found it peculiar that a vehicle owned, most likely, by a  resident of Kingsville would be traveling along I-35, as I-35 is not  the most direct and logical route from Kingsville to either Laredo  or San  Antonio . 

 Agent  Barberena then began to parallel the Maxima on the driver's side,  while Agent Esqueda peered in and relayed what he observed to the  more experienced Barberena. Both of the Maxima's front windows were  rolled completely down. The driver was a woman, later determined to  be Leonor Garcia (co-defendant in this action). After a few seconds, almost 'as if listening to music,'  she began to tap on the steering wheel with her hand, 'nervously.'  Agent Esqueda testified that both rear-cabin windows were now  completely rolled up. Nonetheless, given his elevated vantage point  in the Chevy    Tahoe, Agent Esqueda was able to peer into the Maxima's rear cabin  through the open driver's side window. Within the rear cabin, he was  purportedly able to observe the backseat passenger slouching all the  way back and down and into his seat, 'as if trying to hide.'  Agent Barberena paralleled the Maxima for a full three minutes. The  entire time, the backseat passenger looked away from Agent Esqueda,  he maintains. As for the driver and front-passenger, they always  faced straight forward, and at no point did either of them turn or  look to acknowledge the Agents. 

 Next,  Agent Barberena accelerated and pulled the patrol unit just in front  of the Maxima. He did so in order to give Agent Esqueda a view into  the Maxima's rear cabin through the front windshield, which was not  tinted. Agent Esqueda told Agent Barberena that he could see the  backseat passenger continue 'trying to conceal himself.' 

 The  Agents decided to conduct an immigration inspection of the Maxima's  occupants. They decelerated and pulled the Maxima over at around the  65 mile marker. During inspection, Delacruz, the backseat passenger,  admitted that he was an undocumented alien. Garcia, the driver, and  Defendant Soto were arrested.    

 II. Material  Witness's Testimony 

 Coincidentally,  Delacruz's story differs from that of the Border Patrol agents' with  respect to each of the key facts that would otherwise contribute to  establishing reasonable suspicion for the roving patrol stop. 

 According  to Delacruz, he met Garcia and Defendant Soto in Encinal, and they  agreed to drive him north to San  Antonio .  Although he admits spotting the Border Patrol unit at the side of  the Rest Area between thirty to forty minutes into their drive,  Delacruz contends that the rear, passenger-side window was rolled  fully up at the time. Delacruz allegedly had the window rolled down  at the start of the drive but closed it fifteen to twenty minutes  before first passing the patrol unit at the Rest Area. His stated  reason was that the air blowing into the car bothered him. 

 Delacruz  did not see the patrol unit again until it began to parallel the  Maxima. At this point, Delacruz claims that Garcia and Defendant  Soto were conversing in English and listening to music, just as they  had been doing since the beginning of their drive. Garcia, the  driver, 'played along to the music' on the steering  wheel with her hands the entire trip, Delacruz testified.    

 When  Agent Esqueda began to peer inside the back of the Maxima, Delacruz  claims he looked right back at him. Delacruz asserts that he sat up  straight in his seat the whole time, and that at no point did he  slouch down as if trying to hide from Agent Esqueda's view. After  paralleling the Maxima, Delacruz stated that the patrol unit simply  decelerated and pulled away. He claims it never actually pulled in  front of the Maxima. 


 Discussion 

 I. Legal  Standard 

 Border  Patrol agents on roving patrol may temporarily detain a vehicle for  investigatory purposes only if they are aware of specific  articulable facts, together with rational inferences from those  facts, warranting a reasonable suspicion that the particular vehicle  is involved in illegal activity, such as the transporting of  undocumented aliens. .  To determine whether reasonable suspicion exists in the context of a  roving patrol stop by Border Patrol, a court must consider the  following factors: (1) proximity to the border; (2) the  characteristics of the area in which the vehicle is encountered; (3)  the usual traffic patterns on the road; (4) the arresting agent's  previous experience with criminal activity; (5) information about  recent illegal    trafficking in aliens or narcotics in the area; (6) the appearance  of the vehicle; (7) the driver's behavior; and (8) the passengers'  number, appearance, and behavior. (citing .  Making a reasonable suspicion determination involves looking at the  'totality of the circumstances.' .  And the above-referenced factors 'must not be analyzed in  isolation from each other, but rather as a collective whole.' (citing ).  The likelihood of criminal activity required for purposes of  establishing reasonable suspicion 'need not rise to the level  required for probable cause, and it falls considerably short of  satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.' (citing . 

 II. Analysis 

 After  having analyzed each of the above-referenced factors and considering  them as a whole, the Court concludes that the Border Patrol agents  here had reasonable suspicion to conduct a roving patrol stop of the  suspect Maxima and its occupants. 

 Agents  spotted the suspect Maxima headed north along I-35, which, according  to Agent Barberena, is commonly known amongst Border Patrol as a  route notorious for smuggling  aliens and narcotics. See (reasonable suspicion for roving patrol stop of vehicle first  observed traveling    northbound on I-35 at 74 mile marker between Laredo and San  Antonio ).  What first aroused the Agents' suspicions was the backseat  passenger's behavior. Initially was his look of 'surprise'  upon seeing the Agents' patrol unit at the Rest Area. Next was his  immediate attempt to hide by slouching behind the car's frame and  halfway-open, tinted window. The Maxima's heavily tinted windows  themselves supported the Agents' initial suspicions. See (unpublished opinion) (citing . 

 Defendant  cites as Fifth Circuit precedent that slouching does not support  reasonable suspicion. Indeed, because it is not uncommon for  passengers to slouch in their seats to rest, a more affirmative  indication of an attempt to hide is generally required. ,  ; .  Nonetheless, it is not always the act of slouching itself that  particularly arouses suspicion, but, rather, the timing. ,  .  Here, Delacruz's act of slouching behind the car frame and window  immediately after he saw the patrol unit and the look of 'surprise'  came upon his face created the reasonable impression that he was  attempting to avoid detection. See . 

 Further  arousing the Agent's suspicions was the fact that a  Kingsville-registered    vehicle would be traveling northward along I-35, given that I-35  (again, a known smuggling route) is not the most practical route  from Kingsville to either Laredo or San  Antonio . 

 The  driver's behavior also supported reasonable suspicion. For one, the  driver never acknowledged the Agents as they pulled aside and  paralleled the Maxima. Defendant cites Fifth Circuit precedent  holding that 'a person's failure to establish or maintain eye  contact with a surveilling agent is of no relevance whatsoever to  the Brignoni-Ponce analysis.' (dissenting opinion) (citing ) .  But in its more recent opinions, the Fifth Circuit has clarified  that 'the avoidance of eye contact may or may not be entitled  weight; and it is simply one factor to consider in observing overall  behavior.' (citing ; see,  e.g., (considering driver's failure to acknowledge marked patrol car and  his straight-ahead stare as part of overall behavior). Here, the  driver's failure to acknowledge the Agents takes on greater  significance when considered in tandem with her seemingly 'nervous'  tapping on the steering wheel, a second and noteworthy aspect of her  overall behavior. 

 Another  highly suspicious circumstance was the fact that the    Maxima's rear windows had been rolled completely up by the time the  Agents caught up to and began to parallel the vehicle. This  reasonably led the Agents to believe that the backseat passenger's  continued slouching was an affirmative attempt to hide from the view  of Agent Esqueda, who looked into the Maxima from the passenger seat  of the patrol unit. 

 Finally,  as for the Agents' experience, at the time of the roving patrol  stop, Agent Barberena had served only about two months with Border  Patrol. His limited experience as an actual Border Patrol agent was  buttressed, however, by his prior tenure as a police officer in the  LPD, which involved five years of service as a patrolman. In such  capacity, he was assigned to Laredo's downtown area, where he often  encountered undocumented aliens. And it seems that he was paired up  several times with Border Patrol agents who provided some formal  training in recognizing undocumented aliens in the field. As for  Agent Esqueda, in relaying his observations from the passenger seat  of the patrol unit, he benefited from Agent Barberena's knowledge  and lengthy experience in law enforcement. See .  Regardless, here, the Agents' relative lack of Border Patrol    experience did not, of itself, render their suspicions unreasonable. See  id. 


 RECOMMENDATION 

 Having  considered the totality of the circumstances, the undersigned  Magistrate Judge concludes that there was reasonable suspicion to  support the Border Patrol agents' roving patrol stop of the vehicle  in which Defendant was allegedly transporting an undocumented alien.  As such, the Magistrate Judge RECOMMENDS that the District Judge,  after his independent review of the record, DENY Defendant RICARDO  SOTO's Motion to Suppress (Dkt. No. 33).

 E nd  of Document   

 1  Agent  Esqueda has no previous law enforcement experience.   

 2  With  the front of the patrol unit facing west and perpendicular to I-35,  the end of the bush-line sat about ten o'clock in the Agents'  field-of-vision. Positioned where and how they were, according to  Agent Barberena's estimates, a vehicle traveling at the posted speed  limit of 75 mph would come directly in front of the patrol unit  about five seconds after emerging beyond the edge of the bushes and  would pass out of their field-of-vision after another five seconds.  Here, the Agents were able to observe the Maxima for ten seconds  after it passed the bushes.   

 3  On  September 11, 2009, Garcia pled guilty to transporting Delacruz  within the United States.
