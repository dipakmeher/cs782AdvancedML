 REPORT  & RECOMMENDATION OF THE UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE 

 Currently  pending before the Court are Defendant Ricardo Rodriguez, Jr.'s  'Motion to Suppress,' (Dkt. No. 35), and Defendant Ignacio  Rodriguez, Jr.'s 'Amended Motion to Suppress Written and Oral  Statements,' (Dkt. No. 39), filed April 1, 2013 and April 17,  2013, respectively. On March 5, 2013, Defendants were indicted for  transporting undocumented aliens within the United States, and for  conspiracy to do the same, in violation of .  ( See Dkt. No. 21). These indictments stemmed from a series of vehicle  stops conducted on February 4, 2013. ( See    Dkt. No. 35, at 1-2; Dkt. No. 39, at 1-2). Defendant Ricardo  Rodriguez, Jr. contends that the stop of his vehicle by a United  States Border Patrol agent was not supported by reasonable suspicion  and thereby 'inconsistent with the mandates of the ,'  thus arguing that the fruits of his illegal stop should be  suppressed. (Dkt. No. 35, at 3). In Defendant Ignacio Rodriguez  Jr.'s motion to suppress, he focuses on his traffic stop conducted  by an officer of the Freer Police Department, asserting that the  officer 'overstepped the scope of the stop and the nature of  the interrogation that comes with a traffic stop.' (Dkt. No.  39, at 2). Ignacio Rodriguez also claims that his subsequent arrest  was not supported by probable cause, and therefore seeks to have  'any statements or evidence obtained as a result of the  warrantless arrest . . . suppressed.' ( Id. ).  The Court held a hearing on the pending motions to suppress on May  2, 2013 and May 3, 2013, where the following facts were elicited. 


 I.  BACKGROUND 

 On  the evening of February 4, 2013, United States Border Patrol Agent  Jorge Luis Trevino was stationed at the Freer immigration  checkpoint, 'Echo 43,' on U.S. 59 outside of Freer, Texas.  (May 2nd    Hr'g at 2:12 p.m.; see  also May 2nd Hr'g, Gov't Ex. 2). On that evening, he was 'assigned  to checkpoint and processing,' meaning that he was both  'inspecting the vehicles on U.S. 59 going towards . . .  Corpus or Houston or Freer' and also 'processing some  undocumented . . . illegals . . . at the checkpoint.' (May 2nd  Hr'g at 2:08 p.m.). 'While he was processing . . . inside the  checkpoint building, . . . the primary agent at that time,'  United States Border Patrol Agent Rodriguez, 'called out two  vehicles going southbound, a white one and a black one.' ( Id. at 2:09 p.m.). The two vehicles, a 'white Malibu' sedan  and a 'black Dodge truck,' had exited off of U.S. 59 to  the right and turned southbound onto Farm-to-Market Road 2050, a  road 'adjacent to the Border Patrol station parking lot,'  about '150 feet . . . 200 feet, more or less,' from the  checkpoint office. ( Id. at 2:11, 2:15 p.m.; see  also May 2nd Hr'g, Gov't Ex. 1). 

 After  Agent Rodriguez alerted to the two vehicles, Agent Trevino decided  to go look into the vehicles, because lately the Border Patrol  agents have noticed 'a lot of drop-offs on FM 2050,' where  'vehicles with illegals . . . drop the illegal aliens off .  .    . between the checkpoint and Bruni' so that the aliens can  'then . . . walk east from Farm-to-Market Road 2050 all  the way to Highway 16, and then they get picked up somewhere along  Highway 16, and . . . go to Houston or San  Antonio .'  (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:09 p.m.). These drop-offs are done 'to avoid  the two checkpoints,' the Freer checkpoint on U.S. 59 and the  Hebbronville checkpoint on U.S. 359. ( Id. at 2:12 p.m.). A person could also drive 'the loop'  without encountering a checkpoint, because although FM 2050  intersects U.S. 59 to the west of Freer checkpoint, FM 2050  intersects U.S. 359 to the east of the Hebbronville checkpoint, such  that 'if someone were to want to avoid checkpoints, they would  go U.S. 59, south down FM 2050, and then over to U.S. 359,'  which thereafter connects with Highway 16, allowing access to  Houston or San  Antonio to the north. ( Id. at 2:12-2:13, 2:33, 2:58-2:59 p.m.). 

 Agent  Trevino further testified that FM 2050 is otherwise 'just  ranches,' so the 'only vehicles . . . going southbound and  northbound on FM 2050 are . . . oilfield trucks, tankers,  utility trucks, F-150s, F-250s —that's  what most of the ranchers use.' ( Id. at 2:14-2:15    p.m.). He noted that it was 'very uncommon' for multiple  cars to be turning down FM 2050 together, because vehicles on FM  2050 are 'mostly ranchers and oil trucks, and if you're going  to see a  truck in tandem, it's going to be an oil field  truck.' ( Id. at 2:16, 3:30 p.m.). Agent Trevino acknowledged that there are also  'small cars' on FM 2050 due to the presence of a 'wind  farm' on the road, but stated that although Border Patrol  agents 'don't know the people' in those cars, they 'know  the vehicles, because they drive every single day to work.'  ( Id. at 2:16-2:17 p.m.). Those employees often drive 'through the  checkpoint, and as soon as they get inspected, they turn around and  go back on FM 2050.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:17 p.m.). When asked  what percentage of the vehicles on FM 2050 he recognizes, Agent  Trevino stated that 'ninety, ninety-five percent' of the  vehicles are 'farmers and oil field workers.' ( Id. at 2:17-2:18 p.m.). Those vehicles that he does not recognize he  will 'go out and at least take a look at them.' ( Id. at 2:18 P.m.). 

 Agent  Trevino went to follow the vehicles 'around 6:00 p.m.,'  and by the time he caught up to the vehicles 'enough to . . .  make . . . observations'    and run any license plates, they were 'about . . . ten miles'  down FM 2050. ( Id. at 2:20, 2:21, 2:53 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:06 p.m.). As he  approached, the two vehicles were driving 'in tandem . . . one  in the front, one in the back,' with the black Dodge truck  behind the white car. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:53, 2:55 p.m.). Agent Trevino followed the black  truck for 'around five minutes,' noticing the vehicle  'going often off the shoulder.' (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:08, 1:13 p.m.). The black truck did not appear to  be a 'work truck,' and also 'had a camper,' either 'dark blue or black'  in color, which are commonly used to transport illegal aliens. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:15, 2:19, 2:28, 3:22 p.m.). He 'ran the  plate and the plate came back probably within a minute,'  registered to someone in Corinth, Texas, 'somewhere not close  to Laredo, somewhere north,' 'probably north of San  Antonio ,'  but 'nowhere close to here.' ( Id. at 2:53-2:54 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:07 p.m.). 

 He  then made the decision to pass the black truck and follow the white  car, but since the black truck had 'slowed down when he was  behind it,' the white car was no longer in view, and was  instead 'about two miles ahead.'    (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:08 p.m.). Agent Trevino sped up, nearing eighty  miles per hour, until he was positioned behind the white sedan. ( Id. at 1:09 p.m.). During his testimony, he again noted that there are  'hardly . . . any passenger vehicles out there,' because  'there's no . . . reason' for a vehicle to be on FM 2050  'unless you own a ranch out there . . . or you work for an oil  company, inspecting the oil mills.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:19  p.m.). He explained that, due to the ranches and the oil fields, 'if  you have a small car and if you go off road, . . . you're going to  end up losing a tire or a bumper.' (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:11-1:12  p.m.). The smaller cars that the Border Patrol agents do see are  'the same people,' the owners of the various ranches on FM  2050 and the employees of the wind farm, and 'they go through  the checkpoint' on U.S. 59 and then turn around before heading  down FM 2050 to avoid being followed by any Border Patrol agents. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:18 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:12-1:13 p.m.).  Although Agent Trevino testified that he does not know the owners of  the vehicles that go to the wind farm, he nonetheless recognizes the  vehicles 'as vehicles that go to the wind farm,'  because    'most of the wind farm vehicles have a sticker in the back,'  which allows Border Patrol agents to 'identify the vehicles as  being part of the wind farm . . . .' (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:17  p.m.). Notably, both of the vehicles, the black truck and the white  sedan, lacked this sticker. 

 After  catching up to the white car and calling the license plate in to  dispatch, 'the second vehicle came back . . . out of Dallas,  Texas,' as a rental car from 'Hertz Dallas-Fort Worth.'  ( Id. at 2:15, 2:19, 3:32 p.m.). Agent Trevino explained that, 'from  his experience, a lot of . . . smugglers use the rental cars, so  that if they get caught or busted, they don't lose one of their own  vehicles, they lose . . . a rental car.' (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:10  p.m.). Agent Trevino additionally testified that he thought it 'odd  why those two vehicles from out of town were on that same road,'  and it therefore appeared to him that 'those vehicles . . . had  ties together' and 'both . . . were riding in tandem south  on FM 2050.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:15-2:16, 2:27-2:28, 3:31  p.m.). The two out-of-town vehicles raised his suspicions because FM  2050 'doesn't go anywhere; it's just a connection between  Highway 359 and Highway    59;' he therefore questioned what 'two vehicles out of  Dallas were doing on FM 2050 going southbound, when Dallas is  northbound, north of San  Antonio ,'  noting that the most direct route to Dallas or San  Antonio would be 'Highway 35.' ( Id. at 2:18-2:19 p.m.). 

 Agent  Trevino further testified that, as he followed the white sedan, 'all  of the five passengers in that vehicle were just sitting straight,  just stiff, not looking, not communicating with each other.'  ( Id. at 2:22 p.m.). Although Agent Trevino also stated that the  passengers 'all looked . . . packed in the vehicle,' he  acknowledged on cross examination that the white Malibu was in fact  'designed to hold that many people,' with 'two . . .  sitting in front and three in back.' ( Id. at 2:24, 3:05, 3:13 p.m.). He noted that the white vehicle, too, was  'going on and off the road,' 10 'probably about three times, two times' over 'not a  very far distance,' and the fact that 'the vehicles went  off the road . . . made him believe that the drivers were  nervous because he was behind them.' ( Id. at 2:22 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:10, 1:16 p.m.). The white car also  appeared to be 'riding low,' and 'half of its  passengers were    wearing caps.' 11 (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:22-2:23 p.m.). All of these observations were  made as the 'sun was going down' 12 and 'from behind the vehicle,' not from the side, because,  as previously noted, FM 2050 consists of only two lanes. ( Id. at 2:23-2:24, 3:08, 3:10, 3:12 p.m.). 

 During  the cross examination of Agent Trevino, a more detailed description  of FM 2050 and its surroundings was elicited. Mills Bennett Road is  a 'dirt road' which, 'probably about five miles, six  miles, south of the checkpoint,' intersects FM 2050 and travels  eastward. ( Id. at 2:34, 2:36 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:06 p.m.; see  also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 1, 12). The entrance and office of the  aforementioned wind farm is on the west side of FM 2050 'between  twelve and fifteen miles' from the checkpoint on U.S. 59. (May  2nd Hr'g at 2:39 p.m.; see  also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 14-16). The windmills themselves extend out  to the west of FM 2050 across various ranches. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:43  p.m.). San Pablo Road is south of, but 'really close to, the  wind farm,' and is 'another road that goes to the east off  of FM 2050.' ( Id. at 2:41-2:42 p.m.; see  also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 17-18). Also 'right around' and  slightly    south of the wind farm is the 'Moglia' ranch house, as  well as the 'Stag' ranch trailer. 13 (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:45-2:46 p.m.; see  also May 2nd Hr'g. Def. Exs. 19-20). Farther south down FM 2050 is 'Santo  Nino Road, also known as Dinn Ranch,' which also extends to the  east. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:47 p.m.; see  also May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 1, 21). Both San Pablo Road and Santo Nino  Road extend to Highway 16, providing vehicle access the entire way.  (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:51-2:52 p.m.). 

 About  'a mile and a half south of the wind farm,' past San Pablo  Road, Agent Trevino initiated a stop of the white vehicle because of  'all of those facts together.' ( Id. at 3:00 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:09, 1:11 p.m.). As he activated his  overhead lights, the vehicle once again 'went just a little bit  off the road,' just as it had several times before. (May 2nd  Hr'g at 2:25 p.m.). Once the vehicle was stopped, Agent Trevino  'approached the vehicle and identified himself as a Border  Patrol Agent.' ( Id. at 2:24-2:25 p.m.). The driver of the vehicle, Ricardo Rodriguez,  informed Agent Trevino that he was a United States citizen. ( Id. at 2:25 p.m.). When he inquired into the citizenship of the  passengers, 'they first did    not acknowledge him' and continued to 'look straight,'  but ultimately 'acknowledged they were all Mexicans.' ( Id. at 2:25-2:26 p.m.). Agent Trevino 'counted how many were in the  vehicle' and then asked if anyone else was in the vehicle, to  which Ricardo Rodriguez responded that there were 'two more'  in the trunk. ( Id. at 2:26 p.m.). The trunk passengers also 'admitted' that  they were in the country illegally. ( Id. at 2:26-2:27 p.m.). Once Agent Trevino realized that the white sedan  was 'transporting illegals,' he put information over the  Border Patrol radio 'to be on the lookout' for the black  Dodge truck, which had 'passed him going southbound on FM  2050' during the stop of the white sedan, since he 'believed  that both of them were connected' 'because the two  vehicles were out of Dallas' 14 and because 'both the vehicles were riding in tandem south on  FM 2050.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:27-2:28, 3:23-3:25 p.m.). 

 When  Officer Reymundo Reyes, Jr. of the Freer Police Department reported  to work on the evening of February 4, 2013, he was briefed by the  previous officer, who informed him that the police department had  been advised of a BOLO ('be on the lookout') for a 'black  in    color, Dodge pickup truck.' ( Id. at 3:35 p.m.). Officer Reyes wrote the license plate number of the  black truck on his hand at the beginning of the shift. ( Id. at 3:35 p.m.). Around 8:40 p.m., an hour and a half into his shift,  he 'noticed a vehicle that was passing by him' in the  same direction, traveling northbound on Highway 16. ( Id. at 3:35-3:36, 3:48 p.m.). He noticed it was a black vehicle, and  shortly thereafter recognized that the first three digits matched  what was written on his hand. ( Id. at 3:37 p.m.). He then followed the vehicle for 'three or four  blocks' until it stopped at a traffic light at the intersection  of Highway 16 and U.S. 59, where he was then able to confirm that  the license plate matched the BOLO vehicle. ( Id. at 3:37-3:38, 3:52-3:53 p.m.). The driver of the black truck,  Ignacio Rodriguez, then 'made a right turn' at the  intersection, but 'did not use a turning signal,' so  Officer Reyes decided to conduct a traffic stop. (May 2nd Hr'g at  3:38 p.m.). 

 Ignacio  Rodriguez pulled into a nearby parking lot, where Officer Reyes then  'made contact with the driver, . . . told him who he was,  what the reason for the stop was, and asked him for his driver's  license    and proof of insurance.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:38 p.m.; May 3rd  Hr'g at 3:23 p.m.). Officer Reyes testified that as Ignacio  Rodriguez pulled out his wallet for his driver's license, 'he  was shaking, his hand was shaking a lot, and he . . . seemed  extremely nervous, a little too nervous,' especially  considering that he had been informed that he was pulled over for  failing to use a turn signal. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:39-3:40 p.m.).  Although he provided a driver's license, Ignacio Rodriguez could not  immediately find any insurance; he therefore 'got out of the  truck and went around to the passenger side, and there on the  passenger side  was looking through the glove box,' but was  ultimately unable to provide any proof of insurance. ( Id. at 3:38-3:39 p.m.). As Ignacio Rodriguez 'came back' from  the passenger side of the vehicle, Officer Reyes asked him 'if  he had anything in the vehicle, any contraband or anything like  that,' to which Defendant responded in Spanish, 'no I don't  have anything . . . you can search it.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:45 p.m.;  May 3rd Hr'g at 3:33-3:35, 3:49 p.m.). Officer Reyes informed him to  'just hold on' while he contacted dispatch for a  canine, 15 and Ignacio Rodriguez    did not ask any questions as to how long the search might take. (May  2nd Hr'g at 3:44 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:34, 3:49 p.m.). 

 When  dispatch soon thereafter advised Officer Reyes that the 'owner  of the vehicle was a female, he asked Ignacio whose vehicle it  was, and he said it was his aunt's vehicle.' (May 2nd Hr'g at  3:41, 3:54 p.m.). Officer Reyes also inquired into Ignacio  Rodriguez's travel plans, and he stated that he was 'coming  from Laredo, and he was going to Dallas, Texas,' a statement  which raised Officer Reyes's suspicions, because 'from Laredo  to Dallas, the best route is 1-35, and he was . . . taking 16  towards San  Antonio .'  ( Id. at 3:41-3:42 p.m.). Officer Reyes again asked about the owner of the  truck, and Ignacio Rodriguez 'changed that it was from his aunt  to that it belonged to his cousin.' ( Id. at 3:43 p.m.). All of Officer Reyes's questions came prior to his  issuing the citation. ( Id. at 4:04 p.m.). Because Ignacio Rodriguez 'couldn't provide  any insurance information,  as soon as . . . Officer Reyes  couldn't determine who the owner of the vehicle was, . . . it was at  that point that he didn't know if the vehicle was possibly  stolen' 16 and therefore    decided to impound the vehicle. 17 ( Id. at 3:43-3:44 p.m.). The decision to impound the vehicle was made 'at  the moment that Officer Reyes was writing the ticket,' which  was 'approximately five minutes' after Officer Reyes had  made contact with Ignacio Rodriguez. ( Id. at 3:46, 3:59 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:44-3:45 p.m.). Officer Reyes  finished writing the citation after another three to five minutes  and then returned Defendant's driver's license. (May 2nd Hr'g at  3:56, 4:05 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 3:24 p.m.). Although he 'was  going to let Ignacio Rodriguez go,' 18 Officer Reyes testified that he 'wasn't going to allow the  vehicle to continue to its destination.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 4:05  p.m.). 

 United  States Border Patrol Agent Hugo Benavides, Jr. received a phone call  from his supervisor regarding the traffic stop of Ignacio Rodriguez  'around 8:30, close to 9:00,' and therefore drove 'a  few blocks to the intersection of Highway 59 and Highway 16,'  arriving as Officer Reyes was 'writing the ticket.' 19 (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:33, 1:35, 1:42, 2:38-2:39 p.m.). 'As soon as  Agent Benavides got there, he made contact with the Freer P.D.  officer.' ( Id. at 2:40 p.m.). Within a minute or two, he approached    Ignacio Rodriguez, who 'was outside of the vehicle,'  presented himself as a Border Patrol agent, and asked about  Defendant's citizenship. ( Id. at 1:35, 1:46, 2:40 p.m.). Agent Benavides then asked, as a 'routine  question,' 'where he was coming from and where was he  headed, and Ignacio Rodriguez mentioned . . . that he was coming  from Hebbronville, and he was headed to . . . Dallas, Texas.'  ( Id. at 1:36, 1:46 p.m.). A few minutes later the canine handler and  canine arrived, and Agent Benavides 'let the handler do. . .  what he needed to do' in terms of running the dog. ( Id. at 1:36, 2:39, 2:41 p.m.). During the 'twenty, thirty minutes'  of the canine search, Agent Benavides was 'just standing there  next to the vehicle and to Mr. Rodriguez,' not asking any  questions of Defendant. ( Id. at 1:51, 2:41, 3:47 p.m.). The canine search yielded no indication  of any contraband or illegal aliens. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:55 p.m.). 

 After  communication with his supervisor, Agent Benavides then 'just  told Ignacio Rodriguez that he needed to go with him to the  checkpoint for further questioning, and that he was going to  transport him to the checkpoint,' and also advised Officer  Reyes    of the same. (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:47 p.m.; May 3rd Hr'g at 1:50, 1:52,  2:42, 3:26 p.m.). Agent Benavides stated that he 'didn't give  Defendant the option' to leave, but rather 'just told  Defendant that 'you're going to come to the checkpoint for further  questioning,'' whereby Ignacio Rodriguez 'agreed to come .  . . .' (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:52 p.m.). Agent Benavides's and  Ignacio Rodriguez's testimony made clear that 'Agent  Benavides didn't ask Defendant for permission or nothing; he  just told him' he was going to the checkpoint for questioning.  ( Id. at 2:42, 3:26 p.m.). It was around this time when Agent Benavides  also learned that Ignacio Rodriguez's vehicle was going to be  impounded. ( Id. at 2:40 p.m.). Agent Benavides then 'kind of escorted Ignacio  Rodriguez to his unit, and Defendant freely went inside'  the vehicle without asking any questions; Agent Benavides then drove  to the checkpoint 20 eighteen miles away and placed Defendant inside the checkpoint, in  'an open area' with other agents nearby, before he 'took  off' and returned to his assigned area. ( Id. at 1:58, 2:42-2:44 p.m.). Agent Benavides never informed Ignacio  Rodriguez that he was under arrest and no handcuffs    were used. ( Id. at 1:46, 1:47, 2:43 p.m.). 

 At  'approximately 9:45 p.m.,' Marco Montemayor, Special Agent  for the United States Department of Homeland Security, received a  phone call in Laredo regarding an 'attempted alien  smuggling event.' ( Id. at 2:01, 2:14 p.m.). He arrived at the Freer checkpoint around an  hour later. (May 3rd Hr'g at 2:14 p.m.). After spending five to ten  minutes speaking with 'the primary Border Patrol agent that  conducted the initial stop' to ascertain background  information, Agent Montemayor and his partner interviewed Ricardo  Rodriguez before interviewing Ignacio Rodriguez at 'approximately  11:30 p.m.' ( Id. at 2:02, 2:10-2:11, 2:14 p.m.). Before the interview, Ignacio  Rodriguez was 'inside the Border Patrol station in a holding  cell,' behind a locked sliding door. ( Id. at 2:10-2:11 p.m.). Agent Montemayor, along with another HSI agent  and a Border Patrol intel officer, then interviewed Ignacio  Rodriguez in a 'fairly large' room. ( Id. at 2:36-2:37 p.m.). No one was in uniform, and their weapons were  locked in a 'separate area.' ( Id. at 2:18, 2:37 p.m.). 

 Agent  Montemayor described the beginning of the interview as follows: 'we,  my partner and I, introduced ourselves, we    advised him of his Miranda rights, we then asked him if he understood his rights. After  acknowledgment, we asked him if he wanted to speak to us, and by  doing so, waive his rights. Then we got him to sign off on the Miranda waiver, and then we began asking . . . about the events that  took place and how he subsequently was involved.' ( Id. at 2:03 p.m.). The agents made sure that Ignacio Rodriguez  understood the rights that he was waiving. (May 3rd Hr'g at 2:07,  2:18-2:19 p.m.). After Ignacio Rodriguez waived his rights and  signed a written waiver, he provided the agents with a timeline of  the previous events, but nonetheless changed a few details of his  story several times. ( Id. at 2:03, 2:06 p.m.). Agent Montemayor testified that Ignacio  Rodriguez 'gave his confession freely and willingly, and . . .  was very cooperative' and polite. ( Id. at 2:07 p.m.). Significantly, Defendant never stated that he wanted  an attorney, nor did he renege on his waiver of his rights. ( Id. ).  Agent Montemayor's testimony also made clear that the agents were  'very, very specific about their role and their function,'  never promising leniency or release. ( Id. at 2:16, 2:17 p.m.). 


 II.  DISCUSSION 

 As  noted above, Defendant Ricardo Rodriguez    challenges the stop of his white sedan by United States Border  Patrol Agent Trevino, arguing that 'the factors known to  Agent Trevino at the time of the stop of Mr. Rodriguez's vehicle  fall short of reasonable suspicion as required by the .'  (Dkt. No. 35, at 3). Ricardo Rodriguez therefore moves to suppress  the evidence resulting from said stop. ( Id. ).  Defendant Ignacio Rodriguez instead challenges the traffic stop  performed by Officer Reyes of the Freer Police Department, claiming  'that the stop was illegal or a pretextual stop' and  that 'Officer Reyes overstepped the scope of the stop and the  nature of the interrogation that comes with a traffic stop,'  asserting that 'all statements obtained by the Government  should be suppressed along with any evidence obtained therefrom.'  (Dkt. No. 39, at 2). Ignacio Rodriguez also claims that, while he  'was in Government 'custody and control,' agents of the  Government obtained written and oral statements from him in  violation of his right to counsel' because of the fact that  there was no 'probable cause to arrest him . . . .' ( Id. ).  Although 'a defendant normally bears the burden of proving by  a preponderance of the evidence that the challenged search or  seizure was unconstitutional,'     ,  'when the government searches or seizes a defendant without a  warrant, the government bears the burden of proving, by a  preponderance of the evidence, that the search or seizure was  constitutional.' .  Therefore, in the instant case, because both Defendants were seized  without a warrant, the government bears the burden of proving that  the stops were constitutional. Because of the distinct analysis  required for each of the Defendants' motions to suppress, the  undersigned will address each in turn. Whether United States Border  Patrol Agent Luis Trevino had reasonable suspicion to stop Ricardo  Rodriguez's vehicle is the first issue to be addressed. 


 A.  The Roving Border Patrol Stop of Ricardo Rodriguez 

 'The prohibits 'unreasonable searches and seizures' by the Government,  and its protections extend to brief investigatory stops of persons  or vehicles that fall short of traditional arrest.' (citing .  Therefore, even brief investigatory stops 'must be justified by  some objective manifestation that the person stopped is, or is about  to be, engaged in criminal activity.' .  Roving Border Patrol stops are governed by the standard articulated  in ,  which dictates that Border Patrol agents may temporarily    detain vehicles for investigation only if they 'are aware of  'specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences from  those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion' that the vehicle is  involved in illegal activities.' (quoting ).  Although 'the 'somewhat abstract' and 'elusive' nature of the  reasonable suspicion standard makes it impossible to create 'a neat  set of legal rules' of what constitutes reasonable suspicion,' (quoting ),  reasonable suspicion 'requires more than a mere  unparticularized hunch, but considerably less than proof by a  preponderance of the evidence.' (citing .  Factors that may be considered in the reasonable suspicion analysis  include: (1) proximity to the border; (2) known characteristics of  the particular area; (3) usual traffic patterns of that road; (4)  information about recent illegal trafficking in aliens or narcotics  in the area; (5) the agent's previous experience in detecting  illegal activity; (6) the behavior of the vehicle's driver; (7)  particular aspects or characteristics of the vehicle; and (8) the  number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers. See .  No single factor is dispositive; rather, the reasonable suspicion  analysis 'is a fact-intensive    test in which the court looks at all circumstances together to weigh  not the individual layers, but the laminated total.' (citing .  Agents and officers are entitled to assess the facts in light of  their experience in detecting illegal entry, smuggling, or other  criminal activity. .  Factors that ordinarily constitute innocent behavior may provide a  composite picture sufficient to raise reasonable suspicion in the  minds of experienced officers, ,  but 'obviously only those factors known to the officer at the  time of the stop can be considered when determining whether the stop  was reasonable.' . 

 The  analysis begins with inquiring into the vehicle's proximity to the  border. Proximity to the border has been deemed both a 'paramount  factor' and a 'vital element' in determining  reasonable suspicion, because proximity suggests that the vehicle in  fact originated its journey at the border and is thus more likely to  harbor illegal aliens. See (quoting ; .  Although the Fifth Circuit does not adhere to any bright line rule  regarding this factor, 'a car traveling more than fifty   miles from the border is usually viewed as being too far from the  border to support an inference that it originated its journey    there.' .  Here, Defendants Ricardo and Ignacio Rodriguez turned south before  encountering the 'Echo 43' checkpoint, a checkpoint within  fifty miles of the Mexico border, heading 'closer to the  border.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:30 p.m.; see May 2nd Hr'g, Gov't Ex. 2). Agent Trevino therefore encountered  Defendants' vehicles within the benchmark fifty miles. See (finding the vehicle, 'between 40 and 50 miles from the  border,' on a 'rural, two-lane highway with approximately  90% of its traffic consisting of ranch trucks and hunting jeeps,'  'travelling in an easterly direction, with the towns serviced  by the western direction of the road  all on or very near the  border,' to have originated its journey at the border.).  'Although a reasonable conclusion of proximity to the border  does not alone constitute reasonable suspicion for a Border Patrol  stop . . . , this 'vital element' contributes significantly to the  reasonableness of the Border Patrol agents' suspicions.' (citing . 

 The  second, third, fourth, and seventh aforementioned factors—the  characteristics of the particular area, the usual traffic patterns  of the road, information regarding recent illegal trafficking in  aliens or narcotics    in the area, and the particular aspects or characteristics of the  vehicle—all contribute to a finding of reasonable suspicion in the  instant case. 21 Farm-to-Market Road 2050 consists solely of ranches and a wind farm,  so 'there's no . . . reason' for a vehicle to be on FM  2050 'unless you own a ranch out there . . . or you work for an  oil company, inspecting the oil mills.' 22  See (considering in part 'that there was no development other than  ranches within twenty miles of the intersection' in finding  that there was reasonable suspicion to make the stop, and  distinguishing the case from others where no reasonable suspicion  was found because of 'the presence of a nearby national park').  The majority of vehicles traveling 'southbound and northbound  on FM 2050 are therefore . . . oilfield trucks, tankers, utility  trucks, F-150s, and F-250s . . . .' There are 'hardly .  . . any passenger vehicles out there,' because of the  possibility of 'losing a tire or a bumper' on the ranch  roads. The passenger cars that are on FM 2050 generally belong  either to the owners of the various ranches or to the employees of  the wind farm, and are largely recognizable to Border Patrol agents.  Those vehicles    either pass through the checkpoint before turning down FM 2050,  display a wind farm sticker on the rear of the vehicle, or are among  the vehicles the agents know 'because they drive every single  day to work.' See (noting that 'border patrol agents may reasonably be familiar  with most of the ordinary traffic' in a 'sparsely  populated' area). Notably, Defendants' vehicles, a 'non-work'  truck and a rental passenger vehicle, were neither recognizable by  the Border Patrol agents nor the typical vehicles seen on FM 2050. See (per curiam) ('An agent's inability to recognize a vehicle on a  road that is generally only used by local residents may also  indicate reasonable suspicion . . . .'); ('this Court has in the past given weight to an agent's  observation that a vehicle's appearance was atypical of vehicles in  the particular area in question.'). 

 In  addition to the fact that the two vehicles were not recognizable to  Agent Trevino as vehicles that frequently travel FM 2050 and the  fact that the small passenger-style vehicle and 'non-work'  truck were atypical of the area in general, after running the  registration of the vehicles, Agent Trevino learned that the    white sedan was a rental vehicle registered to Dallas-Fort Worth 23 and the black truck 24 was registered to Corinth, Texas. 'A vehicle's registration  may, under some circumstances, add to reasonable suspicion.' (noting that the Fifth Circuit has previously 'held that the  fact that a car was registered in San Angelo, yet was taking an  indirect route to San Angelo which was less-heavily patrolled, added  to reasonable suspicion,' but finding no reasonable suspicion  in the present case because 'the truck was neither  registered to a faraway place, nor was it taking some sort of  suspicious, indirect route' as it was registered to a location  in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and was 'traveling due east  on the most direct route,' 1-20); see  also (finding that after the agent determined 'the vehicle was not  registered locally,' that since 'the ranch road was rarely  used by any non-ranch vehicles and . . . the agent knew the  vehicles connected with the local ranches by sight. . . . he could  have found it suspicious that a vehicle from another part of Texas,  with no connection to the local ranches, was using that particular  road.'); cf. (because the defendant had a vehicle registered to Dallas    and was heading north on 1-35, 'a well-traveled interstate  highway,' directly towards Dallas, distinguishing the case from Arvizu ,  where 'it was reasonable for the agent to infer from his  observations, his registration check, and his experience that the  defendant had set out . . . along a little-traveled route used by  smugglers to avoid the  checkpoint'). The vehicles with  out-of-town registrations, one of which was a rental vehicle, 25 understandably raised Agent Trevino's suspicions. 

 Although  Defendants could have conceivably been visitors to one of the many  ranches or to the wind farm, Agent Trevino did not pull over Ricardo  Rodriguez until 'a mile and a half south of the wind farm,'  past San Pablo Road, and therefore the vehicles had already passed a  number of these legitimate destinations on FM 2050 by the time Agent  Trevino initiated the stop, as they were already around fourteen  miles down FM 2050. 26 However, in addition to the legitimate destinations located on FM  2050, the road is an ideal smuggling route, such that 'if  someone were to want to avoid checkpoints, they would go U.S. 59,  south down FM 2050, . . . over to U.S. 359,' and then  north on Highway    16, which allows access to 'major highways going north'  to San  Antonio ,  Houston, and beyond. Although a smuggler can simply drive 'the  loop,' Agent Trevino testified that there has recently been a  surge of 'drop-offs on FM 2050,' where smugglers drop  illegal aliens off along FM 2050 and have the aliens walk east  towards Highway 16 to be again picked up by a vehicle heading north.  The testimony provided in this case by the Government and by  Defendant indicated that FM 2050 is frequently and increasingly used  to circumvent the checkpoints on both U.S. 59 and U.S. 359, and  'it is well established that a road's reputation as a  smuggling route adds to the reasonableness of the agent's  suspicion,' even if the road is used for other lawful purposes. (quoting (similarly to the present case, the testimony indicating 'that  to get to San Angelo from Del Rio, and avoid the checkpoint on  Highway 277, one would take RR 2523 north to Highway 377, then go  west on Highway 377 until it joins Highway 277 at a point north of  (beyond) the checkpoint, and then turn north and continue thus on  Highway 277.'); see  also (per curiam) (finding that the 'numerous seizures of aliens'  in the 'particular area' where the    ranch was located 'weighed in favor of reasonable  suspicion'); ('The ranch road was popular with smugglers because it  allowed drivers to travel to northern Texas while avoiding Border  Patrol checkpoints on Highway 59 and Highway 359.'); ('That smugglers regularly use the road is relevant to the  totality of the circumstances evaluation . . . .') ; (finding that 'the road in question,' a farm-to-market  road intersecting with Highway 16, to be 'notorious as a  popular smuggling route,' which added to the reasonable  suspicion for the stop); (giving weight to the fact that 'the road on which the vehicle  was driving was known to the agents' 'as a convenient  route used by smugglers of undocumented persons for purposes of  bypassing a permanent federal checkpoint'). 

 The  fifth Brignoni-Ponce factor a court must consider is the agent's previous experience in  detecting illegal activity, for 'in all situations the  officer is entitled to assess the facts in light of his experience  in detecting illegal entry and smuggling.' ; see  also ('Reasonable suspicion takes its fact-driven meaning from the  totality of the circumstances known to the agent, and the agent's  experience    in evaluating such circumstances.'). In the instant case, Agent  Trevino has been with the United States Border Patrol since May 29,  2006. Even more significant is the fact that he has been working at  the Freer checkpoint 'two or three days out of the week'  since August of 2011, which has led him to now recognize 'ninety  to ninety-five percent' of the vehicles passing down FM 2050. Compare (determining that the knowledge of two Border Patrol agents, one  with six years and one with three and a half years of experience,  'fourteen months of which had been spent patrolling' the  particular area of highway where the vehicle was encountered, to be  'of considerable importance in evaluating the totality of the  circumstances' in that case), and (factoring into the reasonable suspicion analysis that 'the  agents, who were familiar with area residents, did not recognize  the defendant's truck as a local vehicle.'), and (noting that the agent 'had patrolled the road for a year and  was very familiar with the traffic.'), with   (in granting the motion to suppress, giving 'substantial weight  to the fact that the agents were new to the area and were not  familiar with the residents, their vehicles    or traffic patterns,' because the agents had only one week of  experience patrolling the specific highway). Because an agent's  'knowledge of and experience in an area, while not  independently sufficient, is . . . entitled to some weight in an  evaluation of whether the stop was supported by reasonable  suspicion,' ,  Agent's Trevino nearly seven years with the Border Patrol, with a  year and a half of that time stationed at the Freer checkpoint,  tends to support the stop in the instant case. 

 Under Brignoni-Ponce ,  the behavior of the vehicles' drivers is another factor that may be  afforded weight in the reasonable suspicion analysis. See (citing cases describing 'erratic driving' and the 'use  of 'load car—lead car' driving pattern, commonly used by   smugglers' and stating that 'it is beyond dispute that  Border Patrol agents may consider the behavior of a vehicle's driver  in determining whether there is reasonable suspicion to stop that  vehicle.'). Here, Agent Rodriguez alerted to the fact that  Defendants had turned down FM 2050 'in tandem . . . one in the  front, one in the back,' and thus Agent Trevino left the  checkpoint in pursuit of them. Although 'reasonable suspicion  cannot result from the    simple fact that two cars are traveling on a roadway . . . , one in  front of the other,' 'connecting factors' between the  vehicles could rationally lead an agent to believe that the vehicles  are in fact driving 'in tandem.' (citing .  And 'a belief that two vehicles are traveling in tandem in a  lead car and load car arrangement may also contribute to a finding  of reasonable suspicion.' (citing ; see  also (rejecting the argument 'that traveling near the border,  traveling in a high crime area, and traveling in close proximity to  another vehicle on a rarely traveled road are insufficient, by  themselves, to establish reasonable suspicion' and taking into  account the fact that the defendant 'was driving in close  proximity to a pickup on a sparsely traveled road with a reputation  as a smuggling route' in affirming the denial of the motion to  suppress); (noting that 'traveling in tandem' is 'an arrangement  favored by smugglers'). When Agent Trevino initially went to  follow the vehicles, he had no reason to believe that the two were  connected. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:56 p.m.). However, after his two  registration checks came back to Corinth and Dallas-Fort Worth,  locations 'north of San  Antonio ,'    he thought it 'odd why those two vehicles from out of town  were on that same road,' and it therefore appeared to him  that 'those vehicles . . . had ties together' and 'both  . . . were riding in tandem south on FM 2050.' See (adding to the reasonable suspicion for the stop was the fact that  'both automobiles were registered in the same county and in one  other than the county through which they were driving.'). 

 Agent  Trevino explained that, in addition to the fact that the vehicles  were driving in tandem, both vehicles were 'going on and off  the road,' 'picking up rocks and dust,' which 'made  him believe that the drivers were nervous because he was  behind them.' 27 Previous courts have noted that 'when an officer's actions  are such that any driver, whether innocent or guilty, would be  preoccupied with his presence, then any inference that might be  drawn from the driver's behavior is destroyed.' ; see (stating that it was 'not clear whether the defendant swerved  when the patrol car approached him to read his license plate, hardly  suspicious, or if he swerved after the patrol car dropped back,  which could reinforce the officers' suspicions about a driver's  level of nervousness.');     cf. (determining that the defendant's 'deceleration and swerving on  such a road at nighttime, in response to a rapidly accelerating  vehicle with its high-beams on, weighs, at best, only slightly in  favor of the reasonableness' of the stop). Here, Agent Trevino  followed the black truck for 'about five minutes' and the  white sedan 'for a little while' after running each of  their plates, (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:10 p.m.), all the while observing  the vehicles repeatedly 'going on and off the road.' Such  behavior by Defendants, by driving in tandem and running off the  road, adds to the reasonableness of Agent Trevino's suspicions. See (agreeing that 'the fact that the vehicle . . . began weaving  shortly after the agents began following it . . . , which  indicated the driver was watching the agents in his rear-view  mirror,' added to the reasonable suspicion that the driver was  involved in the transportation of undocumented persons). 

 Lastly,  the number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers of a vehicle  also factors into the reasonable suspicion analysis. During the  hearing, Agent Trevino explained that 'all of the five  passengers in that vehicle were just sitting straight, just  stiff,    not looking, not communicating with each other.' Although the  vehicle had five visible passengers, the sedan was in fact 'designed  to hold that many people.' Additionally, as mentioned before,  all of Agent Trevino's observations of the passengers were made from  the rear of the vehicle, because of the nature of the roadway. Any  determination as to whether the passengers in a vehicle are  conversing or not, based on the vantage point Agent Trevino had,  seems tenuous at best, and thus no weight is afforded this  observation. Agent Trevino also noted that 'half of the  passengers were wearing caps.' However, 'a factual  condition that is consistent with alien  smuggling does not provide reasonable suspicion if that condition also occurs  even more frequently in the law-abiding public.' .  This observation, too, adds nothing to the reasonable suspicion for  the stop. Therefore, the eighth Brignoni-Ponce factor does nothing to favor the reasonableness of the roving Border  Patrol stop. Nonetheless, 'under a totality of the  circumstances analysis, the absence of a particular factor will not  control a court's conclusions.' . 

 'The seeks to prevent arbitrary police action, not to require  absolute    certainty before law enforcement officers may investigate,' ,  and thus 'the reasonable suspicion standard clearly does not  require an agent to 'eliminate all reasonable possibility of  innocent travel before conducting an investigatory stop.'  (per curiam) (quoting ).  The majority of the Brignoni-Ponce  factors ,  as scrutinized above, all contributed to the reasonable suspicion  that Defendant's vehicle was involved in illegal activities. See (per curiam) (finding the 'district court properly relied, in  part, upon the following facts in concluding that there was  reasonable suspicion: the defendant was traveling on Highway 85, a  common smuggling route that avoids immigration checkpoints, shortly  after midnight; the agent did not recognize the vehicle as a local  vehicle; and the registration check on the defendant's vehicle  revealed that it was registered near Dallas.'); (per curiam) (concluding reasonable suspicion existed, based in  large part on: 'the area in which the stop took place was known  for illegal activity; the Agent saw two vehicles traveling in  tandem, and his experience taught him that vehicles engaged in  smuggling almost always travel in tandem while other vehicles    in the area almost never do; and the Agent, familiar with the area  and its usual traffic, did not recognize either of the two  vehicles'); ('Viewing the evidence as a collective whole through the lens  of the officers,  finding the following factors provided the  reasonable suspicion necessary to stop the defendant's pickup: (1)  his proximity to the border (35 miles); (2) his proximity to a  drug cache (2 miles); (3) his use of a known drug smuggling route  (U.S. Highway 385) in an area known for drug smuggling (Big Bend);  and (4) his behavior upon sign of the marked patrol car (he  appeared stiff, stared straight ahead, failed to acknowledge the  agent, and slowed down considerably).'). 

 'The  stop here was not merely the result of a lucky hunch; it was based  on articulable factors indicating that illegal activity might be  afoot.' .  The stop thus falls within the bounds of what is lawful under the .  As such, the Magistrate Judge RECOMMENDS that the District Judge,  after an independent review, DENY Defendant Ricardo Rodriguez's  Motion to Suppress. 


 B.  The Traffic Stop and Arrest of Ignacio Rodriguez 

 A  traffic stop constitutes a seizure under the . .  Routine traffic stops, being closer    in nature to investigatory detentions rather than full blown  arrests, are governed by the principles set out in . .  Pursuant to Terry ,  the legality of a police investigatory stop is assessed in two  parts: (1) whether the officer's actions were justified at their  inception, and (2) whether the officer's subsequent actions were  reasonable related in scope to the circumstances that justified the  stop. ; (en banc). The Supreme Court has long held that the 'touchstone  of analysis is reasonableness,' (quoting ,  and 'reasonableness, in turn, is measured in objective terms  by examining the totality of the circumstances.' Id. 

 Although  Defendant Ignacio Rodriguez appears to contest the reasonableness of  his initial traffic stop for failing to use a turn signal, arguing  that the stop was pretextual, this argument has no merit. See (stating that previous Supreme Court cases 'foreclose any  argument that the constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops  depends on the actual motivations of the individual officers  involved.'); ('Although some courts have held that a lawful traffic stop may  nonetheless violate the if the stop was merely a pretext to allow officers to search for  contraband . . . this Court    has rejected that position. In Causey ,  we said that 'so long as police do no more than they are objectively  authorized and legally permitted to do, their motives in doing so  are irrelevant and hence not subject to inquiry.') (quoting ; see  also  (Vernon 2011) ('An operator shall use the signal authorized by to indicate an intention to turn, change lanes, or start from a  parked position.'). 

 Ignacio  Rodriguez also contends that Officer Reyes exceeded 'the scope  of the stop and the nature of the interrogation that comes with a  traffic stop,' (Dkt. No. 39, at 2), and thus we turn to Terry's second prong. A detention must be temporary and last no longer than  is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop, unless further  reasonable suspicion, supported by articulable facts, emerges. See,  e.g., .  An officer conducting a routine traffic stop may request a driver's  license, insurance papers, and vehicle registration, run a computer  check thereon, and issue a citation. (citing other sources). The officer may detain and question the  subjects of a traffic stop during the time a computer check is being  conducted, and a court will generally not scrutinize the particular  questions asked so long    as they do not extend the duration of the stop. (citing ; see  also (rejecting the notion that 'a police officer's questioning,  even on a subject unrelated to the purpose of the stop, is itself a violation.'). Mere questioning is neither a search nor a  seizure, and thus it is 'detention, not questioning, that is  the evil at which Terry's second prong is aimed.' (citing ).  'The is concerned with ensuring that the scope of a given detention is reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.' Id. (citing . 

 In  the instant case, Officer Reyes approached Ignacio Rodriguez, 'told  him who he was, what the reason for the stop was, asked him for  his driver's license and proof of insurance.' At that point,  Officer Reyes could see that 'he was shaking, his hand was  shaking a lot, and he . . . seemed extremely nervous, a little too  nervous.' Although Defendant provided his driver's license, he  was unable to provide proof of insurance, so Defendant 'went  around to the passenger side' to 'look through the  glove box' for it. After the search for proof of insurance for  the vehicle came up fruitless, because of Defendant's extreme  nervousness, Officer Reyes asked 'if he had any  contraband'    in the vehicle. Although Ignacio Rodriguez denied possessing  contraband, he nonetheless gave Officer Reyes his consent to search  the vehicle. 28 Although courts have recognized that 'a detention may be of  excessively long duration even though the officers have not  completed and continue to pursue investigation of the matters  justifying the stop's initiation,' ,  the testimony given in this case indicates that within minutes of  the initial contact, even before Officer Reyes received the results  of the computer check, Defendant had consented to the search of his  vehicle. See  id. ('Because the officers were still waiting for the computer  check at the time that they received consent to search the car, the  detention to that point continued to be supported by the facts that  justified its initiation.'). Upon receiving consent, Officer  Reyes informed Defendant to 'just hold on' while he  contacted dispatch to 'have somebody come' to conduct the  search. 

 Shortly  thereafter dispatch advised Officer Reyes that the 'owner of  the vehicle was a female,' and so he asked Ignacio Rodriguez  'whose vehicle it was, and he said it was his aunt's vehicle.'  Defendant then stated that it 'belonged to his cousin'    instead. Officer Reyes therefore inquired into Ignacio Rodriguez's  travel plans, and he stated that he was 'coming from Laredo,  and he was going to Dallas, Texas,' a statement which raised  Officer Reyes's suspicions because of the route being driven. All of  Officer Reyes's questions came prior to his issuing the citation,  and fall within the ambit of what is permissible under the ,  as the Fifth Circuit 'has consistently approved a police  officer's questioning a driver's travel plans where the driver was  not the authorized vehicle lessee or otherwise appeared to lack  driving authority.' (stating also that lamn officer may also ask about the purpose and  itinerary of a driver's trip during the traffic stop.'). These  questions 'may efficiently determine whether a traffic  violation has taken place, and if so, whether a citation or warning  should be issued or an arrest made.' Id. Here, significantly, 'the questioning did nothing to extend the  duration of the initial, valid seizure.' . 

 The  process, from the time Officer Reyes made contact with Ignacio  Rodriguez until the time he was issuing the citation, took only  'five minutes.' Officer Reyes finished with the citation  after another three    to five minutes and then returned Defendant's driver's license.  Officer Reyes then informed Ignacio Rodriguez that he 'wasn't  going to allow the vehicle to continue to its destination.' 29 It is unclear exactly when Officer Reyes informed Ignacio Rodriguez  that a canine handler and canine were en route, but the testimony  established that a canine arrived 'maybe eight to ten minutes'  after Officer Reyes put the call in to dispatch and about five  minutes after he issued the citation to Defendant. (May 3rd Hr'g at  3:46, 3:47 p.m.). Although Ignacio Rodriguez testified that, based  on his previous experience with law enforcement, he assumed the  search would not 'take more than five minutes,' he notably  did not retract his consent once he realized the search would take  longer than that. 30 ( Id. at 3:35 p.m.); ('Indeed, the Fifth Circuit has recently noted that a  consensual encounter may follow the end of a valid traffic stop  and that such consensual encounters do not implicate concerns.') (citing ; see  also .  The undersigned does not hesitate to conclude that none of Officer  Reyes's actions infringed on Ignacio Rodriguez's rights. 

 Of  course the inquiry cannot end here, as Defendant also contends that  he was subject to an 'unlawful arrest' because there was  no probable cause to arrest him. As indicated above, Agent Benavides  arrived at the scene of the traffic stop as Officer Reyes was  issuing the citation. He approached Ignacio Rodriguez, presented  himself as a Border Patrol agent, and inquired into Defendant's  citizenship and travel plans as 'routine questions.' Agent  Benavides then awaited the results of the canine search before  informing Ignacio Rodriguez 'that he needed to go with him  to the checkpoint for further questioning, and that he was going  to transport him to the checkpoint.' The testimony made  explicit that Agent Benavides 'didn't give Defendant the  option' to leave, but rather 'just told Defendant that  'you're going to come to the checkpoint for further questioning,'  whereby Ignacio Rodriguez 'agreed to come . . . .' Agent  Benavides then escorted Defendant into the back seat of his vehicle  and drove to the checkpoint eighteen miles away, placing Defendant  inside the checkpoint, in 'an open area' with other agents  nearby, sometime between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. Agent Benavides never  informed    Ignacio Rodriguez that he was under arrest and no handcuffs were  used. At some point, however, Defendant was placed 'in a  holding cell,' behind a locked sliding door, and remained there  until Agent Montemayor interviewed him around 11:30 p.m. 

 The  Supreme Court has repeatedly refused to authorize investigative  interrogations at law enforcement stations on less than probable  cause or consent. See,  e.g., ; .  In the present case, Defendant's involuntary transportation to the  Border Patrol station for questioning was 'sufficiently like  an arrest to invoke the traditional rule that arrests may  constitutionally be made only on probable cause.' .  The pertinent inquiry therefore becomes whether Agent Benavides had  probable cause to arrest Defendant at the time of the traffic stop. 

 An  arrest without a warrant is proper only if probable cause supports  it. (per curiam) (citing ; see  also (per curiam) ('The Constitution does not require that a warrant  issue prior to an arrest based on probable cause, even if no exigent  circumstances prevented the obtainment of a warrant.').  'Probable cause for a warrantless arrest exists when the  totality of facts and circumstances within a police officer's  knowledge    at the moment of arrest are sufficient for a reasonable person to  conclude that the suspect had committed or was committing an  offense.' (citing another source); see  also .  An arresting officer need only know with 'fair probability'  that the defendant committed an offense, which requires more than a  'bare suspicion' but less than a preponderance of the  evidence. (citing ).  In evaluating whether probable cause exists, courts are to consider  the 'collective knowledge' of the agents involved in the  events which led to a defendant's arrest. 'Under the collective  knowledge doctrine, it is not necessary for the arresting officer to  know all of the facts amounting to probable cause, so long as there  is some degree of communication between the arresting officer and an  officer who has knowledge of all the necessary facts.' (citing ). 

 Prior  to Agent Benavides's arrival at the location of the traffic stop, he  knew that Agent Trevino had 'encountered some illegals' in  a white sedan on FM 2050. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:29 p.m.). Agent  Benavides's supervisor had also informed him that Agent Trevino 'had  encountered a 'LIS,' the code for smuggling  aliens ,  in the car,' and that the driver, Ricardo Rodriguez,    had been arrested. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:31-1:32 p.m.). Agent Trevino  had encountered the illegal aliens only after running 'another  license plate, for a black truck Dodge' that 'kept going  straight towards U.S. 359' after Agent Trevino pulled over  the sedan. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:29 p.m.). Agent Trevino had therefore  radioed for Border Patrol agents, and particularly Agent Benavides  because of his location on Highway 16, 'to be on the lookout  for that type of a truck.' (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:30 p.m.).  Significantly, the black truck's registered owner and the driver of  the white sedan, Ricardo Rodriguez, had the same last  name—Rodriguez, a fact that was known to Agent Benavides before he  made contact with Ignacio Rodriguez. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:30, 1:31  p.m.). He was also aware of the fact that the two vehicles, one out  of Corinth, Texas and one out of Dallas, 'were riding in  tandem.' (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:30 p.m.). During the hearing, Agent  Benavides stated that he 'remembers that the two cities are  close by.' (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:30 p.m.). Finally, Ignacio  Rodriguez conceded that he was traveling to Dallas, a statement  which validated the Border Patrol agents' suspicions regarding the  route being    driven by the two vehicles. 

 Although  the Fifth Circuit has addressed similar cases, courts in other  circuits have delineated a concise standard with which to analyze  such cases. 'Sufficient evidence that two vehicles are driving  in tandem plus evidence that one vehicle contains contraband can  provide probable cause sufficient to support arresting the driver of  the other vehicle.' . Compare (determining there was 'considerable objective evidence'  that two vehicles were driving in tandem when both were 'a mere  two car lengths apart on a highway in very light traffic during the  predawn hours of the morning' and the first car to be pulled  over 'seemingly waited for the other car to elude the  officer's range of vision before pulling over'), and (concluding that the 'sequentially numbered, out-of-state  specialty license plates' on two vehicles traveling in tandem  indicated a sufficient connection between the cars to arrest the  driver of the second vehicle after determining the first vehicle  contained 'a false compartment beneath the floor') with (finding 'insufficient facts to demonstrate that the pickup  truck was driving in tandem with the Cadillac' when the facts  indicated only    that 'both vehicles had Arizona plates and both were heading  toward Arizona on an Interstate highway,' with the court noting  that 'this is not an instance where two vehicles were  traveling on a seldom-used remote road to avoid detection'). 

 Here,  there was a sufficient nexus between the two vehicles for Agent  Benavides to have probable cause to arrest Ignacio Rodriguez upon  contact with him. 31 It appears that at this time that the Border Patrol agents were  aware that Corinth and Dallas were only 'thirty minutes'  apart. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:30 p.m.). More significantly, Agent  Benavides was aware that the last name of the registered owner of  the black truck was the same as Ricardo Rodriguez's, the driver of  the white sedan who had been arrested for transporting illegal  aliens. Agent Benavides therefore had sufficient evidence to  conclude that the two vehicles were driving in tandem, and thus had  probable cause to arrest. 32  See (noting that the agents 'rightly focused' 'on their  knowledge of the load car-scout car pattern to conclude that the  defendant was participating in the driver of the other vehicle's  drug-smuggling activity, which gave them probable cause to arrest  him.'); see  also (because    the defendant 'possessed a pager and a cellular phone,  had  been seen twice on different roads in the vicinity of a vehicle  containing twenty-eight aliens at a time when those roads were not  normally traveled, and both . . . vehicles had been rented from the  closely located branches of the same nonlocal rental agency,'  concluding that probable cause to arrest was established); (considering that the 'lead car-load car' technique, in  addition to familial relationships between the occupants of the two  vehicles, would have justified an arrest of the occupants of the  second car). 

 The  undersigned therefore concludes that not only was the 'scope of  the traffic stop and the nature of the interrogation' within  constitutional bounds, but that the subsequent arrest of Ignacio  Rodriguez was supported by probable cause. 33 Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge RECOMMENDS that the District  Judge, after an independent review, DENY Defendant Ignacio  Rodriguez's Motion to Suppress. 


 III.  CONCLUSION 

 As  indicated above, the Magistrate Judge RECOMMENDS that the District  Judge, after an independent review, DENY Defendant Ricardo  Rodriguez's and Ignacio Rodriguez's Motions to Suppress.

 E nd  of Document   

 1  During  the hearing, Defendant Ricardo Rodriguez appeared to concede the  fact that the route would be a convenient route for smugglers to  take, as evidenced by the following statements by his counsel during  the cross examination of Agent Trevino: '. . . what a smuggler  wants to do . . . is drive up U.S. 59, make this turn onto FM  2050, and then hope you guys don't pay any attention to him. . . .  And if you don't, then his chances of getting caught are very slim  at that point. . . . The only way is if he just happens to run into  a roving . . . Border Patrolman or gets pulled over by a policeman .  . . .' (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:58-2:59 p.m.). Defendant also  suggested that 'since you can drive down to San Pablo Road,  and then drive over to Highway 16, and then drive up Highway 16,  there's no reason to drop anybody off . . . .' ( Id. at 2:59 p.m.). He also noted that, from Highway 16, 'you can  work your way over to a major highway going north.' ( Id. at 2:33 p.m.). 'That's the reason why smugglers want to get on  16, because once you get on 16, you're . . . kind of home free in a  way; you don't have any more checkpoints.' ( Id. ).   

 2  F-150s  and F-250s are both Ford truck models.   

 3  Although  it is generally assumed that when 'two cars travel together  during a smuggling venture,' the first car operates 'primarily  as a scout car,' the Fifth Circuit has recently noted that the  order of the vehicles is not significant. (per curiam) (quoting .  Smugglers can instead use a 'load car-scout car'  arrangement, 'in which the load car carries the drugs and the  scout car travels behind it to inform the owners of the drugs if  anything happens to the load car, and to distract the police if the  need arises.' .   

 4  The  testimony described Farm-to-Market Road 2050 as a paved road with  only two lanes, one in each direction. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:35-2:36  p.m.; see May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Ex. 12). Agent Trevino also testified that  'there's no shoulder' on FM 2050, so any vehicle straying  from the lane 'will pick up rocks and dust.' (May 2nd Hr'g  at 2:22, 2:35 p.m.). The Court therefore interprets Agent Trevino's  statements that the vehicles went 'off the shoulder' to be  interchangeable with the statements that the vehicles went 'off  the road.'   

 5  Agent  Trevino explained that most of the 'vehicles that he  encounters are F-150s with brush guards, F-250s with their head  rack in the back.' (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:11 p.m.). He continued:  'If you look at the oil companies, most of them use F-150s,  white; they don't use Dodge Rams. That's how I distinguish them.'  ( Id. at 1:12 p.m.).   

 6  No  other witness could corroborate whether there was a camper on the  black truck. ( See,  e.g. ,  May 2nd Hr'g at 4:04 p.m.).   

 7  Although  Corinth is a suburb of Dallas, a city 'approximately . . .  twenty to twenty-five miles' north of Dallas, (May 2nd Hr'g at  2:15-2:16 p.m.), Agent Trevino was unaware of the specific location  of Corinth at the time he pulled Ricardo Rodriguez over.   

 8  He  acknowledged that he does not personally recognize or know the  visitors to the ranches located on FM 2050. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:17  p.m.).   

 9  See  supra note 7.   

 10  Ricardo  Rodriguez appeared to dispute this observation by Agent Trevino when  he testified to the following: 'On my knowledge, the  vehicle did not go off the road. I'm pretty sure it did not,  because I didn't get . . . nervous or anything like that . . . .  Even when the agent approached me, asked me for every question, I  mean I was very cooperative with him and everything, so, no, I don't  . . . think I got off the road at all, pretty much . . . . Even when  I stopped, I stopped right on the road.' (May 3rd Hr'g at 2:59  p.m.).   

 11  Agent  Trevino noted this observation because, for Border Patrol agents,  'it's very common to encounter illegal aliens wearing caps  after walking through the brush.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:23 p.m.).  On cross examination, Ricardo Rodriguez got Agent Trevino to concede  that his written report said nothing about people wearing hats or  people being stiff, nor did it indicate that Agent Trevino observed  the vehicle riding low. (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:14 p.m.). The report did  include the observation that the vehicles repeatedly went off the  road. ( Id. ).   

 12  The  undersigned took judicial notice of the fact that the sun set at  6:22 p.m. on February 4, 2013 in Laredo , Texas .  ( See May 3rd g at 3:21 p.m.).   

 13  During  his cross examination, Agent Trevino testified that he does not know  who lives in either the 'Moglia' ranch house or the 'Stag'  trailer; nor does he know who owns the land and the various houses  on San Pablo Road. (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:45, 2:47, 2:51 p.m.).   

 14  See  supra note 7 .   

 15  Officer  Reyes could not recall exactly when Ignacio Rodriguez was informed  that a canine was coming to conduct the search. (May 3rd Hr'g at  3:49 p.m.).   

 16  During  his testimony, Officer Reyes explained that stolen vehicles are not  necessarily reported stolen immediately, and thus the fact that the  vehicle had yet to be reported did not alleviate his concerns. (May  2nd Hr'g at 3:54 p.m.).   

 17  Officer  Reyes further testified that it was within his rights to impound the  vehicle for lack of proof of insurance, and that it was a decision  within an 'officer's discretion.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:44,  3:57 p.m.). He has impounded between 'eight to ten'  vehicles since the beginning of the year because of 'no  driver's license, no insurance, . . . or expired registration.'  ( Id. at 3:58 p.m.).   

 18  Officer  Reyes indicated that Ignacio Rodriguez 'could have called a  family member to come and pick him up' from the nearby gas  station, and that he did not otherwise tell Defendant he had to  'stay around.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 4:05 p.m.). Ignacio  Rodriguez, on the other hand, testified that he did not feel free to  leave even after he was handed his citation because 'he asked  the Freer patrolman, . . . what time what buses come over so he  could leave, and Officer Reyes said he didn't know,' but  that Ignacio Rodriguez 'needed to wait' for the Border  Patrol agents to arrive. (May 3rd Hr'g at 3:24, 3:27 p.m.).   

 19  Ignacio  Rodriguez suggested that Agent Benavides did not show up until  'twenty minutes' after he 'already had his ticket.'  (May 3rd Hr'g at 3:25 p.m.). However, both Officer Reyes and Agent  Benavides recalled Agent Benavides arriving as Officer Reyes was in  the process of writing the citation. ( See  also id. at 3:44 p.m.).   

 20  Although  Agent Benavides did not recall having any conversation en route to  the checkpoint, Ignacio Rodriguez testified that, on the way to the  Border Patrol station, Agent Benavides 'was asking him a lot  of questions,' using 'bad language' and 'bad  words' and talking 'very rude.' (May 3rd Hr'g at  2:44, 3:27-3:28 p.m.). According to Defendant, Agent Benavides  informed him that he was 'screwed big time . . . and that the  guys in the white car already said everything about him, and he  better start talking, and if not, he was going to jail.' ( Id. at 3:28 p.m.). Ignacio Rodriguez then testified that he did not know  why Agent Benavides was asking him to go the Border Patrol station;  that 'he didn't know what was going on or anything;'  that he did not know who was in the white vehicle; that he 'did  not know how many white cars there were;' that he 'did  not know whose white car it was . . . I mean, there's plenty of  white cars and black cars, all different colors;' and that he  'did not know if they were talking about the same vehicle  or not,' because Agent Benavides 'didn't specify.'  ( Id. at 3:37-3:38 p.m.). Ignacio Rodriguez also retracted the statement  he had given on the stand ten minutes previously that 'the guys  in the white car already said everything about him' and  'screwed him big time,' testifying instead that Agent  Benavides said only 'that they had a white car,' to which  Defendant responded, 'well I don't know what you're talking  about.' ( Id. at 3:37 p.m.). Moments after that, Ignacio Rodriguez appeared to  again change his testimony, stating that Agent Benavides 'said  all these bad words to him,' but had said nothing about a  white car. ( Id. at 3:38-3:39 p.m.).   

 21  The  undersigned does not consider the fact that the vehicle was 'riding  low' to contribute to the reasonable suspicion for the stop. As  indicated during cross examination, the vehicle had five passengers,  which was not more 'than the rate of capacity in the passenger  compartment.' (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:05 p.m.). Agent Trevino had no  reason to believe that there was anybody in the trunk as he  approached the car, and presumed it was 'riding low because  there were five people in it,' and for no other reason. ( Id. at 3:06-3:07 p.m.).   

 22  Defendant  introduced into evidence 'district traffic maps' of FM  2050 and U.S. 59, prepared by the Texas Department of  Transportation, which indicate traffic flow data 'primarily  collected and determined by . . . the Transportation, Planning, and  Programming Division in Austin.' (May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Exs. 6-9;  May 2nd Hr'g at 1:30-1:31 p.m.). Alberto Ramirez, Director of  Transportation, Planning and Development for the Texas Department of  Transportation, Laredo Division, was unable to verify the accuracy  of the data or inform the Court 'the mechanism by which TxDOT  determines' the traffic flow data, but did state that 'it  was his understanding that the data indicated . . . the average  daily traffic' on FM 2050 and U.S. 59. (May 2nd Hr'g at 1:29,  1:31-1:33, 1:36-1:37 p.m.). The maps further indicate that they are  from 2011. ( Id. at 1:39-1:40 p.m.). Despite the potential relevance of these maps,  the undersigned is unable to afford them much weight. Defendant did  not provide any indication as to how the 'average daily  traffic' data is determined, nor could he attest to their  accuracy. Further, there is no way of knowing whether the traffic  data gathered from 2011 is at all indicative of the traffic patterns  in 2013. Most significantly, Agent Trevino focused his testimony on  the type of vehicles traveling on FM 2050, not the number of vehicles traveling that road. The average daily traffic data  provided to the Court suggests nothing about the type of vehicles or the direction of the vehicles on FM 2050, and is therefore of limited, if any,  value to the present analysis. The undersigned must therefore defer  to the testimony of Agent Trevino regarding the usual traffic  patterns on FM 2050, since he has worked at the Freer checkpoint  'two or three days out of the week' since August of 2011.  ( Id. at 2:07, 2:17 p.m.)   

 23  Although  the white vehicle was registered to Dallas-Fort Worth, Defendant  Ignacio Rodriguez actually rented the vehicle at the Laredo  International Airport. (May 2nd Hr'g, Def. Ex. 10). Defendant  Ricardo Rodriguez elicited testimony from Santiago Hinojosa, a  manager with the Hertz rental car company at the Laredo  International Airport, that it was 'not unusual' to rent a  car from one location that is registered to another city or state.  (May 2nd Hr'g at 1:46 p.m.). Cars currently at the Laredo airport  location are registered to 'New York, . . . Florida,  Louisiana,' as their registration 'depends on where the  company purchased them.' ( Id. ).  In essence, a rental vehicle's registration does not necessarily  coincide with where the location the car was in fact rented from.  ( Id. at 1:47 p.m.). Although Agent Trevino testified on cross examination  that he knew Hertz has 'rental car places all over,' ( id. at 3:32 p.m.), he was not asked whether he was aware that vehicles  rented out of one location are registered to distant locations.  Based on Agent Trevino's recurrent testimony that the white sedan  was out of 'Dallas, Texas,' it seems logical to infer that  he was proceeding under the rational impression that the rental  vehicle registered to Dallas-Fort Worth was in fact rented from the  Dallas area.   

 24  Agent  Trevino also testified that the black truck had a 'dark blue or  black' camper. As noted before, this testimony went  uncorroborated by Officer Reyes and Agent Benavides. Although  campers are frequently seen by courts as tools of the smuggling  trade, see ('The vehicle that was stopped was carrying a camper, which are  commonly used to transport aliens.'); (finding that the defendant's 'vehicle, a truck with a camper  shell which could easily hide several illegal aliens, was of a type  frequently used by smugglers.'); Orona-Sanchez,  648 F.2d at 1041 (stating that 'the agents testified . . . that alien  smuggling was frequently done by the use of a pickup with a camper shell.'),  the undersigned gives little weight to this observation in the  instant case because of the ambiguity surrounding the existence of  the camper.   

 25  Agent  Trevino noted that, 'from his experience, a lot of . . .  smugglers use the rental cars, so that if they get caught or  busted, they don't lose one of their own vehicles, they lose . . . a  rental car.' See   (stating that 'alien  smugglers frequently use vehicles such as . . . rental vehicles to  transport illegal aliens.').   

 26  Additionally,  had the Defendants wanted to travel to Bruni at the southern  terminus of FM 2050 or to one of the ranches at the southern end of  FM 2050, or instead travel to Hebbronville or any other location on  U.S. 359, the most direct route out of Laredo would have been U.S.  359, which travels in an easterly direction, instead of traveling  northeast on U.S. 59 before turning directly south onto FM 2050. Or  had Defendants originated their journey outside of Laredo, where  U.S. 359 was not immediately accessible, perhaps at Ranchitos Las  Lomas on U.S. 59, the more direct route to Bruni would still not be  FM 2050, but rather another Farm-to-Market Road called FM 2895. The  only advantage of taking the indirect route of U.S. 59 to FM 2050  is, as indicated previously, to avoid the Hebbronville checkpoint on  U.S. 359. See (taking note of the fact that the route taken by the defendant  'would not be the most direct route,' but would rather 'be  a route designed to avoid stationary checkpoints').   

 27  Although  the testimony elicited during the hearing described FM 2050 as  having no shoulder and as 'real narrow' with 'sharp  turns,' (May 2nd Hr'g at 2:24 p.m.), the testimony also  indicated that Agent Trevino could drive this 'real narrow'  road at eighty miles per hour. Thus, the undersigned still gives  credence to the fact that Agent Trevino thought the Defendants'  driving was an aberration from the norm, and 'made him  believe that the drivers were nervous because he was behind  them.' Additionally, although Ricardo Rodriguez testified  otherwise, he qualified his testimony with statements such as '  I'm pretty sure it did not' and 'I don't . . . think I got  off the road.' Although credible, Defendant's testimony was  much more speculative than Agent Trevino's, and thus his testimony  does not call into question the validity of Agent Trevino's  observations. Notably, neither Defendant contested the fact that  Ignacio Rodriguez's vehicle was driving 'on and off the road.'   

 28  Defendant  acknowledged during the hearing that he consented to have his  vehicle searched, and thus the validity of the consent is not at  issue.   

 29  Because  Ignacio Rodriguez 'couldn't provide any insurance  information,' and because Officer Reyes 'couldn't  determine who the owner of the vehicle was,' Officer Reyes  became concerned that the vehicle was stolen and therefore decided  to impound the vehicle while he was writing the citation. (citing )  (emphasizing that officers are allowed to 'draw on their own  experience and specialized training' to make inferences from  facts, such as 'the fact that a vehicle has not yet been reported stolen does not necessarily mean that the vehicle has not actually been stolen.'). Officer Reyes testified that he was within his  rights to impound the vehicle based on Defendant's lack of proof of  insurance. See  , .  However, this issue need not be directly addressed as it is not  central to any of Defendant's arguments. ( See Dkt. No. 39, at 2).   

 30  The  undersigned briefly notes that Ignacio Rodriguez did testify that he  asked Officer Reyes 'what time the buses come over so that  he could leave,' but was told that he 'needed to wait.'  When he asked why he could not leave, Officer Reyes allegedly told  him that the 'canine was coming' to search the vehicle.  This testimony conflicts with that of Officer Reyes, who stated that  he never told Defendant that he needed to 'stay around'  and was not otherwise asked about any bus schedule. Based on  Defendant's conflicting testimony, see  supra note 20, and therefore his questionable credibility, the undersigned  chooses to afford weight to Officer Reyes's account of the events,  and finds that entirety of the search was consensual. Even if the  undersigned were to give weight to Ignacio Rodriguez's testimony  that he was detained against his will until Agent Benavides showed  up 'twenty, twenty-five' minutes later, the undersigned  nonetheless finds that Officer Reyes had reasonable suspicion to  detain Defendant until Border Patrol's arrival. Officer Reyes  testified that he was aware that Border Patrol agents had  'encountered . . . a white passenger vehicle . . . with  illegal aliens' and that 'there was a black truck with it,  but that it was unknown what the truck's involvement was.'  (May 2nd Hr'g at 3:40 p.m.). Officer Reyes also testified that  Defendant was extremely nervous despite being informed that he had  committed only a minor traffic infraction; Defendant could not  verify the owner of the vehicle, and changed his story as to who it  belonged to; Defendant could not provide any proof of insurance; and  Defendant acknowledged that he was traveling to Dallas from Laredo,  but was nonetheless taking a notably roundabout route. All of these  facts provided sufficient reasonable suspicion to temporarily detain  Defendant. See  (citing    .   

 31  Although  Agent Benavides testified that he 'wasn't sure' if he  could have arrested Ignacio Rodriguez, (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:53-1:54  p.m.), 'the subjective belief of an individual officer as to  whether there was probable cause for making an arrest is not  dispositive,' ,  as probable cause is measured against an objective standard. .  Furthermore, 'even if the decision to place the defendant in  the holding cells constituted a  de facto arrest, probable cause warranted that arrest.' .   

 32  Confusingly,  Defendant appeared to concede as much, when during the cross  examination of Agent Benavides, he was able to get the agent to  agree to all of the following statements: 'Okay, but you . . .  were at the same location where Officer Reyes had stopped him to  give him a traffic citation, . . . and by that time, you knew that  there was a black truck, you knew that the driver was a last name  Rodriguez, and you knew that the truck was registered to somebody in  Corinth, Texas.' (May 3rd Hr'g at 1:54 p.m.). 'And you had  been listening to the radio about the stop that Agent Trevino made  on the sedan, and that he had also caught, or found, five or six  illegal aliens . . . in the vehicle.' ( Id. ).  'So, by that time, you had information sufficient to arrest Mr.  Rodriguez on the spot once you arrived.' ( Id. ).   

 33  Defendant  does not appear to argue that there was any Miranda violation or that Agent Montemayor somehow infringed upon his  constitutional rights, and therefore that issue is left unaddressed.
