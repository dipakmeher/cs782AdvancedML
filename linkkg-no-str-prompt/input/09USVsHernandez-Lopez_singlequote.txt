 ORDER 

 On  this date, the Court considered Hernandez-Lopez's appeal from his  conviction for misdemeanor illegal entry. After careful  consideration, the Court will REVERSE the conviction. 


 Background 

 On  August 22, 2006, Defendant was charged in an information as follows:  'On or about June 12, 2006, within the Southern District of  Texas, the Defendant DANIEL HERNANDEZ-LOPEZ, who was then and there  an alien, upon his entry into the United States from Mexico at or  near Hidalgo, Texas, did knowingly elude examination and inspection  by immigration officers and was later apprehended on or about June  23, 2006 in San  Antonio ,  Texas within the Western District of Texas. All in violation of  Title .' 

 A  bench trial was held on August 30, 2006 before a United States  Magistrate Judge. The Defendant was    found  guilty and sentenced to 90 days imprisonment. The Defendant timely  appealed this conviction. 


 Standard  of Review 

 In  connection with an appeal from a magistrate judge's judgment of  conviction, the defendant is not entitled to a trial de novo by a  district judge. The scope of the appeal is the same as in an appeal  to the court of appeals from a judgment entered by a district judge. See  . 

 Accordingly,  this Court reviews the Magistrate Judge's finding of guilt after a  bench trial to determine whether it is supported by any substantial  evidence. Evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction if any  rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence  established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In conducting this  inquiry, this Court examines the evidence as a whole and construes  it in the light most favorable to the verdict. .  Thus, to prevail, Defendant must show that the Magistrate Judge's  conclusion that Defendant knowingly eluded examination and  inspection by immigration officers was one that no rational trier of  fact could have reached. 


 Analysis 

 At  trial, Special Agent William Jensen testified    that  the Defendant was arrested on April 19, 2006 as a result of a raid  at the IFCO Pallet System. Although he was present in the United  States illegally and was previously deported, because he did not  have any criminal history, he was allowed to voluntarily return to  Mexico on April 20, 2006 by walking across the international bridge  in Laredo , Texas . 

 Special  Agent Timothy James McElligott testified at trial that he read an  article that appeared in the San  Antonio newspaper wherein a lady stated that she had brought her boyfriend  Daniel back into the United States after he was deported in the IFCO  raid. Special Agent McElligott further testified that he reviewed the IFCO  arrest records and noted that only one Daniel was arrested that day.  The IFCO arrest paperwork indicated that Daniel's address was 215  North Olive, San  Antonio ,  Texas. ICE Agents thereafter began a surveillance of that address on  June 21, 2006. ICE Agents subsequently found the Defendant and his  girlfriend Imelda Lopez at that address on June 23. 

 After  his arrest and Miranda warnings given, the Defendant was interviewed by Special Agent Joe  Cisneros. The Defendant told Special Agent Cisneros that he crossed  into the United States on June 12 near Reynosa, Texas, that he paid  someone $ 100 to assist him in crossing, and that once he crossed he  walked four or five days to San  Antonio . 

 The  ICE agents also testified that the Defendant's girlfriend's Suburban  had made two border crossings at Laredo , Texas in May. 

 The  Defendant called as a witness, Oscar Barrientos, a former Border  Patrol employee. Barrientos testified that he crosses the border on  a frequent basis, and that on an occasional basis he and his  passengers have been waived through with no further inquiries being  made. 

 Defendant  argues that the Magistrate Judge erred in denying a judgment of  acquittal because he cannot be convicted based on his uncorroborated  confession regarding his manner of entry into the United States.  Specifically, Defendant    argues  that there is no independent evidence that he eluded examination and  inspection by immigration officers as charged. Defendant argues that  his girlfriend acknowledged in the San  Antonio newspaper article that she picked him up at the border, that it is  possible that border agents merely waived them through and there was  no eluding examination and inspection as charged. 

 The  Defendant correctly states that a defendant cannot be convicted  based solely on his uncorroborated confession. 'The Supreme  Court ruled years ago that 'an accused may not be convicted on his  own uncorroborated confession.' That has been immutable doctrine  ever since. The government must introduce independent evidence which  would tend to establish the trustworthiness of the confession.' (citations  omitted). 

 However,  as stated    by  the Fifth Circuit, 'the doctrine is not as unyielding as it  seems.' Id. 'The corroborative evidence alone need not prove the  defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, nor even by a  preponderance, as long as there is substantial independent evidence  that the offense has been committed, and the evidence as a whole  proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty?.  Extrinsic proof is sufficient which merely fortifies the truth  of the confession, without independently establishing the crime  charged. The corroborating independent facts need only support the  'essential facts admitted sufficiently to justify a jury inference  of their truth.' 'The evidence corroborating a confession must tend  to connect the accused with the crime. Corroboration is satisfied if  the accused by his confession demonstrates knowledge of the time,  place or method of the offense.' 'If there is extrinsic evidence  tending to corroborate the confession, the confession as a whole is  admissible; and some elements of the offense may be proven entirely  on the basis of a corroborated confession.'' (citations omitted). 

 Taking  all the evidence together, the confession is not    substantially  corroborated. Rather, the evidence contradicts the confession. The  only evidence the Government proffered on the issue of eluding  examination and inspection by immigration officers was the  uncorroborated confession. 

 The  Government could have, but failed to, charge and try the Defendant  under which provides that any alien who has been excluded, deported, or  removed, and thereafter is at any time found in the United States  shall be fined or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both. As  indicated above, however, the Government charged and tried this case  under and accordingly was required to prove that the Defendant knowingly  eluded examination and inspection by immigration officers. The  Government failed to proffer competent evidence to meet its burden. 


 Conclusion 

 The  conviction and sentence is REVERSED. 

 It  is so ORDERED. 

 SIGNED  this 23rd day of August, 2007.

 E nd  of Document   

 1  In  part, the article stated that after Daniel's deportation he was  forced to live in a ramshackle apartment in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico,  was a victim of an attempted mugging,    and  suffering from poor health. As a result, Defendant's girlfriend,  Imelda Lopez, stated despite fear of arrest for alien  smuggling ,  she put Daniel in her vehicle and crossed the international bridge  from Neuvo Laredo to Laredo , Texas .   

 2  The  Government objected at trial to the use of the newspaper article as  hearsay to relay what Ms. Lopez may have said. The Government argued  that it introduced the newspaper article merely to establish why a  surveillance was conducted at Lopez's residence. The Magistrate  Judge did not rule on the objection. Ms. Lopez did not testify at  trial.
