 MEMORANDUM  OPINION and ORDER 

 Defendant  Rogelio Valero-De La Rosa having filed a motion for relief under ,  and the Court being advised, 

 IT  IS ORDERED that Defendant's motion be, and the same hereby is, DENIED for the reasons which follow. 

 Valero  appeals from the amended judgment of conviction and sentence imposed  by the district court on March 2, 2011 (D.E. 29). He filed this timely Motion on February 27, 2012. (D.E. 34; Civil Action No. L-12-27). 


 STATEMENT  OF THE CASE 


 A.  Course of Proceedings 

 On  March 16, 2010, Valero was charged with illegal re-entry after  deportation in violation of (D.E. 1). On May 13, 2010, pursuant to a plea agreement with the  government, Valero entered a plea of    guilty  to the indictment (D.E. 14). As part of the plea agreement, Valero  agreed to waive his right to appeal the sentence and to collaterally  attack his conviction and sentence, including filing a 2255 Motion  (D.E. 15). 

 On  March 2, 2011, the undersigned, sitting by designation, sentenced  Valero to serve 82 months of imprisonment consecutive to 8 months of  imprisonment for his violation of supervised release for a total  term of imprisonment of 90 months in the custody of the Bureau of  Prisons (D.E. 29, p. 3). 

 Consistent  with the provisions of his plea agreement, Valero did not appeal.  Rather, inconsistent with his plea agreement, he filed the instant motion on February 27, 2012 (D.E. 34). 


 B.  Statement of Facts Underlying the Conviction and Sentence 

 1. Offense  conduct. 

 The  plea agreement Valero entered into with the Government contained the  following 'Factual Basis for Guilty Plea': 

 14. Defendant  is pleading guilty because he/she is guilty of the charges contained in Count One (1) of the Indictment, and the  facts set forth by the United States meet the elements of the crime  he/she is pleading guilty to on this date. If this case were to proceed to trial, the  United States could prove   each element of the  offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The following facts, among others, would be offered to establish the  defendant's guilt: 

 Defendant  is a native and citizen of Mexico with no documents allowing him to enter, travel through, or remain  in the United States. Defendant was previously removed from the  United States on or about March 12, 2008 from Brownsville, Texas to  Mexico. Thereafter, Defendant was found in the United States on or  about December 21, 2009 at or near Laredo , Texas .  There is no record that the defendant had ever applied for or  received the permission of the United States Attorney General or the  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to apply to  re-enter the United States after his removal. 

 (D.E.  15, p. 7-8 (emphasis added)). Valero acknowledged that these facts  were true by signing the plea agreement. See  id. ,  p.9. 

 2. Guilty  Plea and Plea Agreement 

 In  addition to the factual basis Valero agreed to, in the plea  agreement, inter  alia ,  he expressly waived his right to collaterally attack his conviction  or sentence in a motion, as follows: 

 7.  Defendant is aware that Title affords a defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed.    The  defendant agrees to waive the right to appeal the sentence imposed  or the manner in which it was determined. Additionally, the  defendant is aware that Title ,  affords the right to contest or 'collaterally attack' a  conviction or sentence after the conviction or sentence has become  final. The defendant waives the right to contest his/her conviction  or sentence by means of any post-conviction proceeding. 

 (D.E.  15, p. 4 (emphasis added.)) Valero signed the Plea Agreement, as  well as the 'Plea Agreement Addendum,' which stated: 

 I  have consulted with my attorney and fully understand my rights with  respect to the charges pending against me. My attorney has fully  explained and I understand all my rights with respect to the  provisions of the United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines  Manual which may apply in my case. I have read and carefully  reviewed every part of this plea agreement with my attorney. I  understand this agreement and I voluntarily agree to its terms. 

 (D.E.  16, p. 2). 

 At  the rearraignment hearing, Valero executed a waiver of the right to  plead guilty before a United States District Judge as well as a  consent to proceed before a United States Magistrate    Judge.  ( See D.E. 18, p. 1.) In open court, Valero agreed to plead guilty to the  Indictment, the Government summarized the written plea agreement,  the Court explained that the district court may consult the  sentencing guidelines in determining his sentence and explained the  range of punishment. ( Id .)  The Magistrate Judge found that Valero had consented orally and in  writing to enter the guilty plea before the Magistrate Judge, 'fully  understands the nature of the charges and penalties,'  'understands his Constitutional and statutory rights and wishes  to waive those rights.' ( Id. ,  p. 2.) The Magistrate also found that Valero's plea 'is made  freely and voluntarily,' and that he 'is competent to  enter this plea of guilty,' and that 'there is an adequate  factual basis for this plea.' ( Id. )  The Magistrate Judge recommended that the district court accept the  guilty plea and enter final judgment of guilt against the defendant.  ( Id. )  In her Report and Recommendation to the district court, the  Magistrate Judge noted that 'the parties may file objections to  this Report and Recommendation within fourteen days after being  served with a copy of the Report and Recommendation. 

 On  June 8, 2010 Senior    United  States District Judge Kazen entered an Order stating, inter  alia ,  'Noting no opposition by the Defendant to the Report and  Recommendation, the Court ORDERS that the Report and Recommendation  of the United States Magistrate Judge be and is hereby adopted.'  (D.E. 19). 

 3. The  Sentence. 

 Prior  to sentencing, the probation office prepared a presentence report  ('PSR') which calculated the advisory Guideline  imprisonment range based on a total offense level of 21 and a  criminal history category of V to be 70 to 87 months, and the  statutory maximum term of imprisonment to be 20 years, pursuant to .  (PSR ¶¶ 48, 49). 

 Valero's  counsel filed objections in support of a motion for downward  departure for a criminal history score that over-represents the  seriousness of Valero's criminal history because he received two  criminal history points for a prior conviction at the age of 18,  over 9 years earlier, and three criminal history points for a  conviction at the age of 19, which occurred over 8 years earlier.  The probation office responded: 

 The  probation officer does not agree. The criminal history points have  been correctly calculated and all applicable guidelines have been  applied,    pursuant  to .  The offense committed by the defendant at the age of 18 was for  aiding and abetting the illegal reentry of undocumented aliens where  he received three years' probation, which was revoked and  sentenced to 3 months' imprisonment. The conviction at the age of  19 was for transportation of a certain undocumented alien within the  United States by means of a motor vehicle for private financial  gain, win which he was sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment, and  eventually revoked to 6 months' confinement. Although these  arrests occurred over 8 years ago, they demonstrate a pattern of the  defendant violating the immigration laws of the United States. 

 (PSR,  Supplemental Addendum). Valero's counsel also asked the Court for a  downward variance from the guideline range and to impose a sentence  'that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary,'  pursuant to . ( Id. )  In addition, Valero's mother, grandmother and wife submitted  'character letters' for the Court to consider at the time  of sentencing. Valero's wife specifically stated that Valero  'regrets his decision of re-entering the United States  illegally.' See PSR, Second Supplemental Addendum. 

 At  sentencing, the Court asked Valero directly whether he had seen the  PSR and whether he had any objections to it. (D.E. 40, p. 2). Valero  stated that he had seen it and had no objections. ( Id .,  p. 3). Counsel argued the circumstances on the case in support of  the downward departure motion. ( Id. ,  p. 3-6). Valero then spoke on his own behalf. ( Id. p. 6). 

 The  Court said that the criminal history was appropriately calculated  and does not warrant a departure. At an offense level 21, criminal  history category V, the advisory guideline range found by the Court  is 70 to 87 months, with an additional 8 months for the revocation  of supervised release, to be served consecutively. ( Id. ,  p. 7-8). The Court sentenced Valero to serve 82 months of  imprisonment consecutive to 8 months of imprisonment for his    violation  of supervised release, for a total term of imprisonment of 90 months  in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (D.E. 29, p. 3). When asked  Valero expressly stated that he had no 'questions or objections  regarding that sentence.' (D.E. 40, p. 9). 

 4. Valero's  Instant Claims 

 Valero  first alleges that counsel was constitutionally ineffective because  he 'recommended that Valero sign a plea agreement which  contained waivers of appeal and provided zero benefit to Valero  which Valero could have attained via a 'straight up' plea.'  (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground One); (D.E. 35, p. 9-16). 

 Valero  next alleges that counsel was constitutionally ineffective for the  alleged failure to recognize the 'request a downward departure  based upon amendment 740 for cultural assimilation of the United  States Sentencing Guidelines which became active four months prior  to his client's sentencing.' (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground  Two); (D.E. 35 p. 16-19). 

 Valero's  third argument is that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective  by failing to recognize that the single recency point added to  Valero's criminal history score was incorrect due to the elimination  of recency points by Amendment 742, effective    November  1, 2010. (D.E. 87, § 2255 Motion, Ground Three); (D.E. 89 p.  20-22). 

 In  his penultimate argument, Valero claims that his counsel was  ineffective for failing to 'either (1) request a motion from  the Government for a 'fast track' downward departure as part of his  plea agreement, or (2) request a downward departure from the court  at sentencing as the 'fast track' program was no longer available in  Laredo.' (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground Four); (D.E. 35, p.  22-28). 

 Finally,  Valero claims that counsel was constitutionally ineffective by  failing to investigate Valero's 'claim that he was in fact a  United States citizen and therefore was factually innocent of  Illegal Re-entry.' (D.E. 34, § 2255 Motion, Ground Six); (D.E.  35 p.28-40). 


 C.  Enforcement Of The Plea Agreement 

 The  government seeks to enforce the plea agreement. In this regard, it  is noted that Valero's motion asserts claims of ineffective  assistance of counsel. A liberal reading of Valero's motion discloses that most of Valero's allegations regarding his  sentence and dissatisfaction with counsel, fall within the scope of  his waiver because, on their face, they are not direct challenges to the  voluntariness of    his  plea and, therefore, the waiver. See .  On the other hand, an ineffective assistance claim survives a waiver 'only when the claimed ineffective assistance directly  affected the validity of that waiver or the plea itself.' Id. In this case, none of Valero's claimed ineffective assistance  grounds directly affect the validity of the waiver or the plea. 

 Valero  challenges the validity of his plea in Ground 1 only. However, the  allegations in Ground 1 conflict with the record and are otherwise  without merit for the reasons which follow. 

 Valero  voluntarily waived his right to bring this instant action in his  plea agreement and at his rearraignment. Valero entered into a plea  agreement where, in exchange for the Government's promise to not  oppose the 2 acceptance of responsibility points and to move for the  third point consistent with the requirements of ,  he agreed to a broad and unequivocal waiver of collateral relief.  The Plea Agreement expressly stated the following: 

 10.  Defendant is aware that Title affords a defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed. The  defendant agrees to waive    the  right to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was  determined on any grounds set forth in title .  Additionally, the defendant is aware that Title ,  affords the right to contest or 'collaterally attack' a  conviction or sentence after the conviction or sentence has become  final. The defendant waives the right to contest his/her conviction  or sentence by means of any post-conviction proceeding, including  but not limited to Title . 

 (D.E.  22, p. 5, ¶10.) 

 During  Valero's rearraignment, in a colloquy with the presiding magistrate  judge, Valero testified that he had time to talk with his attorney  and was satisfied with his attorney's help in this case (D.E. 69, p.  6). Valero testified that he understood the rights he was giving up  by pleading guilty. (D.E. 43, p. 15-16, 22). Further, Valero  acknowledged that he understood the consequences of the waiver of  appellate rights and his right to 'appeal' his conviction  and sentence under the provision of . Id. The Court made the finding that Valero understood the nature of a  voluntary plea, and, after Valero entered a plea of guilty, found  that his plea was knowing    and  voluntary and he entered into the plea agreement knowingly and  voluntarily. 

 Valero's  sworn statements in open Court are entitled to a strong presumption  of truthfulness. (citing .  The Fifth Circuit gives 'great weight to the defendant's  statements at the plea colloquy.' .  Valero's sworn statements preclude the relief he seeks in this  proceeding. 

 Valero  knew the potential punishment he faced. He also knew his plea was  knowing and voluntary. Valero's testimony was abundantly clear that  his decision to plead guilty was voluntary and that no one had  forced or coerced him to plead guilty. (D.E. 69, p. 17). 

 Under  the terms of the plea agreement, Valero should be held to the  bargain to which he agreed. He  knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to file a motion .  Accordingly, Valero's motion fails, in its entirety, because he specifically waived the  right to file such a motion. 

 The  record supports the conclusion that: 

 (1)  the plea agreement and the waiver contained therein were knowing and  voluntary; 

 (2)  the    waiver  provision in the plea agreement is enforceable and supports the  government's motion for summary judgment; and, 

 (3)  the waiver and the record in this case preclude Valero from  asserting all of the grounds in his current motion. 


 D.  An Alternative Basis for Denying Relief 

 Each  of the claims raised by Valero will be separately addressed. None of  them warrant relief. 

 Initially,  Valero claims in his 'Affidavit' that he never discussed  it, did not know it contained a waiver of rights, and did not know  that he did not have to sign the Plea Agreement. (D.E. 35, p. 9-10).  These claims are directly contradicted by Valero's own statement in  his Plea Agreement Addendum, (D.E. 16, p. 2), his signing the Plea  Agreement (D.E. 15, p. 9), and by the Magistrate Judge's finding  that Valero 'fully understands the nature of the charges and  penalties' and 'understands his Constitutional and  statutory rights and wishes to waive these rights,' and that  his 'plea is made freely and voluntarily.' (D.E. 18, p.  2). 

 Valero  has failed to make a credible showing of deficient performance on  the part of his counsel in the face of contradictory written  evidence in the record, including his express acknowledgment that    he  is satisfied that his attorney had rendered effective assistance,  and that he understands the rights that he had, all as set forth in  paragraph 13 of the Plea Agreement. Valero's belated conclusory  assertions on this point are insufficient to invalidate the knowing  and voluntary plea which included his express acknowledgment that he  'understands and agrees that each and all waivers contained in  the Agreement are made in exchange for the concessions made by the  United States in this plea agreement.' (D.E. 15, p. 4 (¶9)).  Those concessions, in paragraph 10 of the plea agreement, obligated  the United States to do what it was otherwise not obligated to do,  that is, not to oppose a downward adjustment of 3 levels for timely  acceptance of responsibility. 

 Valero's  statements under oath are entitled to a strong presumption of  truthfulness. .  Indeed, the Fifth Circuit affords 'great weight to the  defendant's statements at the plea colloquy.' .  The record contradicts Valero's claim that he did not understand his  rights and the charges against him. Additionally, Valero's waiver of  his right to file a motion pursuant to     was  knowing and voluntary. 

 Because  Valero's challenge to the validity of his plea agreement fails, the  Court can find that the Plea Agreement and his waiver of rights contained therein are valid and enforceable. See .  As noted, it is clear from the rearraignment that Valero understood  that he was waiving his right both to appeal (except under certain  circumstances) and to file any motion which is all that is required for his waiver to be  enforceable. See (waiver is knowing if defendant understood he had a right, and  understood he was giving it up). The claim in Ground One is  dismissed as barred by his knowing waiver, contradicted by the  record and otherwise insufficient to show that counsel's  recommendation that he enter into the plea agreement was 'below  an objective standard of reasonableness.' 

 In  short, none of Valero's arguments compel the conclusion that his  plea or the appeal waiver was unknowing or involuntary. The record  reveals that he understood the nature of the charges, was admonished  as to the constitutional rights he was waiving, and was advised of  the potential sentences he faced.    In  addition, he confirmed under oath that he was entering a knowing and  voluntary plea that was not the result of threats or coercion. Every  time Valero was asked if he understood the court's admonishments, he  answered affirmatively. 'Solemn declarations in open court  carry a strong presumption of verity.' ('The subsequent presentation of conclusory allegations  unsupported by specifics is subject to summary dismissal, as are  contentions that in the face of the record are wholly incredible.'); (holding that the defendant's 'statements that his plea was  knowing and voluntary and that he understood the rights he was  waiving create a presumption that in fact the plea is valid'). See  also (finding no error in district court's refusal to hold an evidentiary  hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel claim where, at  rearraignment, the judge reiterated much of what was set forth in  the plea agreement, which the defendant represented to the court  that she read and understood). 

 Valero  has failed to show deficient performance by counsel. His    allegations  are belied by the record that shows a knowing and voluntary plea. He  has failed to rebut the presumption that the statements he made  under oath during the hearing were true. The initial claims made by  Valero are dismissed. 

 The  second argument made by Valero is that his counsel should have  requested the district court to apply amendment 740 to the  Guidelines, which authorizes a downward departure under on the basis of cultural assimilation. Amendment 740 also took  effect on November 1, 2010. 

 However,  Valero's claim that counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective  assistance due to his alleged failure to request a downward  departure or variance based on cultural assimilation or family  circumstances is both contradicted by the record and without merit.  The record reflects that the undisputed facts of the case do not  merit consideration for a guideline departure for cultural  assimilation. 

 In  determining whether a counsel's conduct is deficient, the Fifth  Circuit has cautioned that attorneys should not be subjected to  unrealistic standards and that, when reviewing a motion, 

 We  recognize the tendency, when all else fails, to blame the lawyer.  With that in mind,    it  bears repeating: 'Representation is an art, and an act or  omission that is unprofessional in one case may be sound or even  brilliant in another.' As we have indicated in the past, the  acuity of hindsight is not our proper lens. We will not subject  attorneys to unrealistic standards. 

 (citations omitted). Keeping that standard in mind, the Government  contends that defense counsel's conduct was not objectively  unreasonable. See ('An attorney's failure to raise a meritless argument thus  cannot form the basis of a successful ineffective assistance of  counsel claim because the result of the proceeding would not have  been different had the attorney raised the issue.') 

 The  Court was made aware by both counsel and the defendant, as well as  the PSR, of Valero's family situation and of his membership in a  gang, periods of incarceration, violation of the laws of the United  States by returning illegally after deportation and violating  supervised release by committing additional offenses, using drugs,  failure to report as directed, failure to participate in drug  treatment. See PSR    ¶¶  24-26., 31-34. It would have been frivolous to argue that a  defendant who had repeatedly illegally returned to the United states  after deportation, who had engaged in alien  smuggling ,  who had used aliases, who listed no substantial assets or  liabilities on his financial statement was 'culturally  assimilated' to a degree warranting a downward departure or  variance from the indisputably correctly determined guideline range. 

 Even  if counsel had argued more extensively for a downward variance or  departure based on Valero's unexceptional family situation and on  his 'reasons' for knowingly breaking the law by returning  illegally after every deportation, the Fifth Circuit has held that a  court may consider a defendant's cultural assimilation, but is not  required to give it dispositive weight. .  Had his counsel raised this issue, it would not have received  favorable consideration in light of the factors outlined above.  Thus, Valero cannot establish that his counsel was constitutionally  deficient on this ground. 

 In  his third ground for relief, Valero complains counsel was  ineffective at sentencing for failing to rely on Guidelines  Amendment    742  for calculation of criminal history points. Amendment 742 to ,  effective November 1, 2010, eliminated points previously assigned  based on the recency of committing the instant offense less than two  years after an offense counted in .  As noted above, when Valero was sentenced on March 2, 2011, his  criminal history calculation included one additional point because  the instant offense was committed less than two years after his  release from custody. PSR ¶ 32. His criminal history points  amounted to 11, placing him in category V. The Amendment 742  argument was not advanced at sentencing by counsel. 

 The  alleged error by counsel in Ground Three is not an attack on the  validity of the waiver or the plea, and is, therefore waived and  should be dismissed on the basis of the waiver. In addition, the  2009 edition of the Guidelines Manual was used. See PSR ¶ 12. Obviously, the 2009 edition included the recency point  and did not consider the amendment which was not effective until  November 1, 2010. More importantly, Valero cannot show prejudice.  Even if the one additional point for recency had been subtracted  from his criminal history computation, Valero would still    have  10 criminal history points, and would remain in Category V. His  advisory guidelines range would be unchanged. Valero's argument that  the Court might have given him fewer months of imprisonment if he'd  had only 10 criminal history points is purely speculative (not to  mention unfounded) and cannot serve to satisfy the prejudice prong  of .  The calculation of a criminal history score and the issue whether  the defendant's criminal history is under-represented are not  commensurate inquiries. In providing for departures under ,  the Sentencing Commission recognized that a defendant's 'criminal  history score is unlikely to take into account all the variations in  the seriousness of criminal history that may occur.' . 

 In  light of these facts, counsel's failure to object to the single  recency point which did not affect the advisory guideline range does  not demonstrate prejudice and fails as the basis for an  constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The claim  in Ground Three is dismissed as without merit. 

 The  alleged error by counsel in Ground Four is not an attack on the  validity of the waiver    or  the plea, and is, therefore waived and should be dismissed on the  basis of the waiver. In addition, it is wholly without merit. 

 The  so-called 'fast track' programs allow certain defendants  to plead guilty and to waive certain rights very early in the  criminal process, in exchange for a motion by the government for  downward departure pursuant to . provides: 'Upon motion by the government, the court may depart  downward not more than 4 levels pursuant to an early disposition  program authorized by the Attorney General of the United States and  the United States Attorney for the district in which the court  resides.' Thus, the 'fast track' program, initially  established in district courts along the southwestern border of the  United States in order to accommodate the large number of  immigration cases, authorizes the prosecution to offer defendants  some form of sentence reduction in exchange for the waiver of  certain procedural rights. See . 

 Valero  has not provided any evidence that an early disposition, or 'fast  track,' program was available to him in the Laredo Division or  that he could have received    any  benefit from the program. Accordingly, his counsel was not deficient  for failing to ask for that benefit, nor is there any prejudice to  Valero as a result of such failure. ('An attorney's failure to raise a meritless argument ...  cannot form the basis of a successful ineffective assistance of  counsel claim because the result of the proceeding would not have  been different had the attorney raised the issue.'). 

 To  the extent that Valero claims that counsel was constitutionally  ineffective by failing to argue that the district court should  exercise its discretion to impose a sentence that would minimize the  sentencing disparity created by fast track programs in some  sentencing jurisdictions but not others, a district court is not  required 'to factor in, when sentencing a defendant, the  sentencing disparity caused by early disposition programs' to  prevent a sentence from being unreasonable.' .  In addition, any sentencing disparity resulting from fast track  disposition programs is not unwarranted as the disparity was also  intended by Congress. See .    Again,  counsel's performance was not constitutionally deficient for failing  to raise a meritless claim. See . 

 In  addition, Valero has not shown that there was a reasonable  probability that but for counsel's failure to make this 'disparity'  argument the result would have been different. Valero's argument  amounts to nothing more than wishful thinking given his criminal  history. 

 Valero  claims that he is a United States citizen and his counsel was  constitutionally ineffective for failing to investigate that alleged  fact. However, his claim that he is a United States citizen is  refuted by the record, which was available to counsel. For example,  the indictment to which Valero entered a guilty plea charged that he  was 'an alien who had previously been . . . . deported.'  (D.E. 1). He conceded or admitted his status as an illegal alien and  a native and citizen of Mexico numerous times in open court and  under oath. ( See,  e.g. ,  D.E. 15, p. 7-9); (D.E. 16, p. 2); PSR ¶ 3. The magistrate judge  found that Valero 'fully understands the nature of the charges'  and his waiver of statutory rights to those charges. (D.E. 18). In  his Plea Agreement he    expressly  'waived any right to have the facts the law makes essential to  the punishment either charged in the Indictment or proven to a  jury.' (D.E. 15, p.1 ¶ 1). The PSR reported that when Valero  was interviewed by ICE agents, he 'admitted being a native and  citizen of Mexico who illegally entered the United States on or  about December 23, 2009 by wading the Rio Grande near Laredo , Texas ,'  and that he 'did not possess or obtain any documents that would  allow him to enter or remain in the United States legally.' PSR  ¶7. The PSR went on to state that: 

 In  a brief statement to the United States Probation Officer, Mr.  Valero-De La Rosa admitted  he knew it was illegal for him to return, or attempt to return to  the United States because of his previous deportations to Mexico However, despite his  prior deportations, he illegally re-entered the United States  December 23, 2009, by wading across the Rio Grande River at Laredo , Texas ,  to reunite with his family, which includes his mother and siblings  in Laredo , Texas .  The defendant  is remorseful for his actions and apologized for violating the laws  of the United States. 

 PSR  ¶ 11 (emphasis added). Valero told the probation officer that he  was    a  Mexican citizen born on July 18, 1982 in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas,  Mexico. PSR ¶ 38. The PSR also reported: 

 While  incarcerated for his previous felony, defense counsel assisted the  defendant with his application for derivative citizenship with the  Department of Homeland Security/citizenship and Immigration Services  in San  Antonio ,  Texas. During the application process, his paternal grandmother  submitted a petition for an alien relative wherein she described  that the defendant's father intermittently resided in Nuevo Laredo,  Tamaulipas, Mexico and Texas during his childhood. Immigration  authorities subsequently denied the application based on the fact  that the defendant failed to prove that his father was physically  present in the United States from the age of 16 through 20 (1978 to  1982) which failed to meet the criteria of him being present for ten  years, five after the age of 14, and prior to the defendant's birth. 

 PSR  ¶ 39. Additionally, the PSR noted a 'character letter'  from the Valero's wife in which she said he 'regrets his  decision of re-entering the United States illegally.' PSR,  Second Supplemental Addendum. 

 Accordingly,  because Petitioner expressly admitted in the Plea Agreement    that  he was not a United States citizen, and because there is no  indication that the Plea Agreement was not knowingly and voluntarily  entered into, Petitioner failed to show that his counsel, who was  made aware of all of these facts in the PSR, was constitutionally  ineffective for failing to investigate further and argue that Valero  was a United States citizen. Counsel's conduct in the face of  Valero's repeated admissions and acknowledgment of his alienage  cannot be shown to have fallen 'below an objective standard of  reasonableness.' See . 

 Valero  has failed to rebut the presumption that counsel's conduct falls  within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. He has  failed to show that both deficiency and prejudice resulted from  counsel's alleged errors in any of his allegations. The motion  should be dismissed with prejudice as barred by his valid waiver of  collateral attack in his plea agreement and, alternatively, without  merit. 

 The  motion and the record of this case conclusively show that no relief  is warranted. Consequently, there is no need for an evidentiary  hearing. . 

 IT  IS ORDERED that    Valero's  motion be, and the same hereby is, DENIED. 

 IT  IS FURTHER ORDERED that the government's motion for summary judgment/motion to dismiss  Valero's motion be, and the same hereby is, GRANTED. 

 IT  IS FURTHER ORDERED that Civil Action No. L-12-027 be, and the same hereby is, DISMISSED with prejudice. 

 A  certificate of appealability is denied as no reasonable jurists  could differ on the outcome of this case. 

 This  is a final judgment. 

 This  the 6th day of August, 2012.

 E nd  of Document   

 1  'D.E.'  refers to the docket entry in Criminal No. L-10-612, styled  Valero-De-La-Rosa ,  in the Laredo Division of the United States District Court for the  Southern District of Texas.   

 2      provides  that a 'court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not  greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in  paragraph (2) of this subsection,' and it enumerates several  factors a court 'shall consider' in determining an  appropriate sentence, including 'the nature and circumstances  of the offense and the history and characteristics of the  defendant,' .
