     PER CURIAM: 

 Michael  Brett Jacquinot appeals his conditional guilty plea conviction and  sentence for possession with intent to distribute marijuana. He  argues that the district court erred by: (1) denying his motion to  suppress the evidence obtained from a roving border patrol stop of  the truck in which he was a passenger and (2) applying to increase his base offense level for possession of a firearm. We  affirm. 


 I.  FACTS 

 Michael  Brett Jacquinot was indicted for possession with the intent to  distribute between 100 and 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, in  violation of .  Jacquinot moved to suppress the evidence obtained as the result of  the stop of a vehicle in which he was riding, asserting that the  border patrol agents did not have reasonable suspicion to stop the  vehicle. 

 An  evidentiary hearing was held on Jacquinot's motion. Border Patrol  Agent Andrew P. Graham, a three-year veteran of the    Border Patrol, testified that he and eleven-year veteran Border  Patrol Agent Jay Snodgrass were stationed in Alpine, Texas, and were  assigned to patrol a 140-mile area of the United States/Mexican  border, including the Big Bend National Park. While Graham's patrol  experience was all in the Alpine, Texas, area, Snodgrass had  transferred to Alpine a few months earlier, having previously served  at the Marfa Sector Area Operations Center and the Laredo , Texas ,  border area. During his tenure with the Border Patrol, Graham had  been involved with at least 30 narcotics cases and 15 to 20 alien  smuggling cases. 

 Texas  Highway 385 is notorious for smuggling, and in the prior six months,  Agent Graham had noticed an increase in alien and smuggling  apprehensions on that highway. Agent Graham attributed this increase  in activity on Highway 385 to the Border Patrol's enhanced  enforcement on other nearby highways. 

 In  the early morning hours of Sunday, January 16, 2000, Agents Graham  and Snodgrass were parked on Highway 385, approximately 75 miles  north of the United States/Mexican border. At 5:45 a.m., the agents  were notified by Marfa Sector Communications that vehicle sensors  located inside Big    Bend National Park and well within 50 miles of the United  States/Mexican border had indicated two northbound vehicles  traveling from within the park. The area in which the sensors are  located is very remote and is intersected only by ranch roads. The  fact that two vehicles activated the sensors at approximately the  same time made Graham suspicious that one may be a lead car and the  other a load car carrying contraband. Subsequent vehicle sensors  were triggered, indicating to Agent Graham that the two vehicles  that had triggered the first sensor were continuing toward their  location. 

 At  approximately 6:45 a.m., Agent Graham observed two vehicles pass by  his location. Agent Graham believed that these were the vehicles  that had activated the first sensor within the park, and he and  Agent Snodgrass began to follow them in separate marked Border  Patrol vehicles. The first vehicle that had passed the agents'  location was a late model four-door sedan carrying an older Anglo  couple and bearing a park registration receipt taped    to the windshield and a Mississippi license plate. The vehicle  appeared typical of the tourist traffic coming out of the park.  Agent Graham got directly behind the    vehicle to check its registration, and the vehicle continued to  drive normally. Agent Graham concluded that the first vehicle was  probably not involved in any illegal activity. 

 The  second vehicle was a large white Ford pickup truck with a lot of  equipment in its bed; it appeared to be a work truck and did not  have a park sticker on its windshield. Agent Graham was able to see  only that the driver was a small-framed person wearing a baseball  cap. Agent Graham was surprised to see a work truck coming out of  the park on a Sunday morning before six o'clock. He normally saw  construction vehicles leaving the park in groups at the end of the  work day or on Friday evenings at the end of the work week. The  truck bore a Kansas license plate, which made Agent Graham  suspicious because the park typically hires contractors from the  local area. Additionally, Agent Graham was aware of a recent  narcotics smuggling operation in the Alpine area destined for  locations in Kansas. 

 Agent  Graham got to within two car lengths of the truck to read the  registration and then followed the truck from ten car lengths.  Agents Graham and Snodgrass continued to follow the truck while they  awaited registration information    on it. The truck slowed to fifteen miles per hour below the average  speed limit. Typically, Agent Graham does not see vehicles  dramatically change their speed unless the vehicle was not traveling  the speed limit before being followed by an agent. The agents were  unable to obtain the registration information because of  computer-system problems, but they continued to follow the truck. As  the truck approached Marathon, Texas, it stopped at a stop sign,  activated its left turn signal, and then remained stopped for five  seconds before turning left onto Highway 90. Agent Graham found the  truck's pause at the stop sign to be much longer than what he  normally sees. Agent Graham also found the truck's left turn to be  strange because most vehicles coming up Highway 385 would continue  straight on that road toward Fort Stockton and Interstate 10. By  turning left, the truck began traveling toward Alpine; however, the  most direct and logical route of travel from Big Bend to Alpine is  Highway 118. In Agent Graham's experience, most visitors to such a  remote area with limited gas stations have a map and know which  roads to take.  

 The  truck then drove through Marathon at 20 miles per hour. There  was    a school zone sign limiting speeds to 20 miles per hour when the  sign was flashing, but the sign was not flashing, it was a Sunday  morning, and there were no pedestrians, children, or other vehicles  on the street. Agent Graham felt that the truck was trying to avoid  being pulled over. Agent Graham confirmed Agent Snodgrass' prior  observation that the truck was carrying tool boxes, a spare gas  tank, and an air tank. After following the truck for a total of  approximately fifteen minutes, Graham determined that it was more  likely than not that the truck was involved in illegal activity. His  determination was based on: the unusual hour that this apparently  non-tourist work vehicle left the park; the truck's Kansas license  plate, since he had personal experience with a smuggling  organization transporting marijuana from the Big Bend area to  Kansas; the absence of a park registration sticker on the vehicle,  indicating that it had not been in the park for any length of time;  the fact that the truck appeared to have transited the park from the  west side to the east side, which was a tactic smugglers had  recently    been using to circumvent Border Patrol traffic or checkpoint  operations; Highway    385's reputation for the smuggling  of aliens and narcotics; and the driver's behavior when they were following  the truck. Agent Graham stopped the truck 70 or 80 miles from the  United States/Mexico border. 

 The  district court denied Jacquinot's motion, determining that the  agents' stop of the truck was justified by reasonable suspicion and  did not violate the .  Jacquinot entered a conditional plea of guilty, reserving his right  to appeal the denial of his suppression motion. The presentence  report ('PSR') applied a two-level adjustment to  Jacquinot's base offense level for the possession of a dangerous  weapon, as two unloaded handguns had been found in the truck. See  .  Jacquinot filed an objection to the adjustment, arguing that it was  clearly improbable that the weapons had been connected to the drug  offense. The district court overruled Jacquinot's objection to the  two-level adjustment.  

 The  district court sentenced Jacquinot to 46 months' imprisonment, three  years' supervised release, a $ 2,500 fine, and a $ 100 special  assessment. Jacquinot filed a timely notice of appeal. 

 II.  ANALYSIS 

 a.  Roving Border Patrol Stop 

 Jacquinot    asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to  suppress the evidence obtained from the stop of the truck. He  contends that the circumstances known to the border patrol agents  did not give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the truck was  involved in illegal activities. 

   In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, the district  court's factual findings are reviewed for clear error, and its legal  conclusions, including whether there was reasonable suspicion for a  stop, are reviewed de novo. .  A factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is  plausible in light of the record as a whole. .  Further, 'the evidence presented at a pre-trial hearing on a  motion to suppress is viewed in the light most favorable to the  prevailing party.' .  

   A border patrol agent conducting a roving patrol may make a  temporary investigative stop of a vehicle only if the agent is aware  of specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences  from those facts, that reasonably warrant    suspicion that the vehicle's occupant is engaged in criminal  activity. See ; .  Factors that may be considered in an analysis of reasonable  suspicion include: (1) proximity to the border; (2) characteristics  of the area; (3) usual traffic patterns; (4) agent's previous  experience in detecting illegal activity; (5) behavior of the  driver; (6) particular aspects or characteristics of the vehicle;  (7) information about recent illegal trafficking in aliens or  narcotics in the area; and (8) the number, appearance, and behavior  of the passengers. ; see  also .   The reasonable suspicion analysis is a fact-intensive test in which  the court looks at all circumstances together to weigh not the  individual layers, but the laminated total. (5th Cir.),  .  Factors that ordinarily constitute    innocent    behavior may provide a composite picture sufficient to raise  reasonable suspicion in the minds of experienced officers. Id.   

 In  the instant case, the district court found that the totality of the  circumstances provided the agents with reasonable suspicion to  warrant the stop of the truck in which Jacquinot was driving. The  court identified the following Brignoni-Ponce factors as supporting the validity of the stop. 


 Proximity  to the border 

 One  of the vital elements in the reasonable suspicion test is whether  the agents had reason to believe that the vehicle in question  recently crossed the border. .  Although this court does not adhere to a bright line test with  regard to this factor,   a car traveling more than 50 miles from the border is usually viewed  as being too far from the border to support an inference that it  originated its journey there. .  The proximity element is satisfied, though, if the defendant's car  was first observed within 50 miles of the United States/Mexico  border, but was stopped more than 50 miles from the border.     See .  If there is no reason to believe that the vehicle came from the  border, the remaining factors must be examined charily. . 

 The  district court determined that although the truck was first sighted  by the agents approximately 75 miles from the border, the activation  of vehicle sensors in an area much less than 50 miles from the  border, the absence of major roads intersecting Highway 385 between  the border and the point where the truck was first sighted, and the  arrival of the vehicle at a time consistent with the sensor alerts  'unquestionably indicated' that the truck was traveling  through an area very close to the border prior to the stop. The  district court's finding in this regard was not clearly erroneous;  the finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole. .  The district court went on to conclude that the  proximity-to-the-border element supported the agents' reasonable  suspicion determination.  

 Jacquinot  asserts that the proximity-to-the-border factor should weigh    against a finding of reasonable suspicion, as the agents had no  reason to believe that his truck had recently crossed the border.  However, given the district court's accepted factual finding that  the precipitate events clearly indicated that the truck had traveled  through an area very close to the border prior to the stop, the  agents did in fact have a reason to believe that the truck had  recently crossed the border. Therefore, this factor does provide  support for the stop. Cf. (rejecting proximity-to-the-border factor where vehicle was stopped  60 miles from border and there was no independent reason to believe that the vehicle had not started its journey in  either of the two towns between the border and the area of the  stop).  


 Characteristics  of the area 

 Based  on Agent Graham's testimony that Highway 385 has a reputation as a  smuggling route, the district court concluded that the  characteristics of the area supported a finding of reasonable  suspicion. While Jacquinot does not dispute that Highway 385 is a  notorious smuggling route, he notes that it is also a major highway  used by thousands of visitors to Big Bend National    Park, citing .  And he points out that this court has cautioned that   a vehicle's    mere presence on a road frequently used for illegal activity is not  sufficient to justify a stop, citing .  

 Nevertheless,  'it is well established that a road's reputation as a smuggling  route adds to the reasonableness of the agents' suspicion.' (emphasis added) (quotation and citation omitted). This factor  weighs in favor of reasonable suspicion. 


 Usual  traffic patterns 

 Agent  Graham testified that traffic is typically very light coming out of  Big Bend before six o'clock in the morning and that he was surprised  to see a work truck leaving the park so early on a Sunday morning.  The district court thus considered the truck's presence on the  highway at that time to be a deviation from the typical traffic  patterns that added to reasonable suspicion.  

 Jacquinot  argues that leaving Big Bend early in the morning should not  contribute to reasonable suspicion. He notes that Agent Graham  testified that it was not unusual for park visitors    to get an early start on their trip home. However, Agent Graham  specifically testified that he did not believe he had ever seen a  work vehicle leave the park on a Sunday morning and that such  vehicles typically leave in groups at the end of the work day or  work week. The traffic-pattern factor weighs in favor of reasonable  suspicion. 


 Agents'  previous experience in detecting illegal activity 

 Agent  Graham testified that he had three years' experience serving as a  Border Patrol agent in the Alpine area and that Agent Snodgrass had  eleven years' experience as a Border Patrol agent, with a few months  of that experience in the Alpine area. The district court concluded  that the agents' previous experience in the region contributed to  the reasonable suspicion determination. This factor supports the  stop. 


 Behavior  of the driver 

 Agent  Graham testified that as he followed the truck, it: slowed  dramatically to fifteen miles per hour below the speed limit,  although it had not previously been speeding; remained stopped at a  stop sign for five seconds; made an unusual turn and traveled toward  Alpine on an indirect route; and obeyed a school zone sign that  limited speeds while flashing,    although the sign was not then flashing. The district court  concluded that the driver's behavior added to the agents' reasonable  suspicion.  

 Jacquinot  argues that it was not suspicious for the truck to slow down after  Agent Graham followed it within two car lengths, passed it, and then  got behind it again. He further contends that it would not be  unusual for a prudent out-of-state traveler to stop at the Highway  385 and Highway 90 intersection for five seconds to determine the  way to the nearest town, which was Alpine, or to travel at Highway  90's posted speed limit of 20 miles per hour. 

   Although deceleration in the presence of a patrol car may be  completely innocent behavior, this court has noted that such  behavior may be suspicious if the driver was not speeding when first  observed. See .  And while it is questionable whether the truck's five-second pause  at the stop sign and adherence to the school zone speed limit were  especially suspicious, the truck's indirect travel route from Big  Bend to Alpine does trigger suspicion. See (approving the district court's consideration of an indirect    route as a factor supporting reasonable suspicion). This court  affords due weight to the inferences law enforcement officers draw  from historical facts and the events leading up    to a stop. Id. Considering the totality of the driver's behavior, this factor  weighs in favor of reasonable suspicion. 


 Particular  aspects of the vehicle 

 Agent  Graham testified that the truck: was not a tourist-type vehicle, but  a work vehicle carrying tool boxes, a gas tank, and an air tank; did  not have a park sticker on its windshield, indicating that it had  not been in any tourist areas of the park for any length of time;  and bore a Kansas license plate, although the park uses local  contractors. The district court did not err in determining that the  appearance of the truck contributed to the agents' reasonable  suspicion. 

 Although  the district court did not specifically address it, the factor  regarding information about recent illegal trafficking in aliens or  narcotics in the area is also relevant in this case. Agent Graham  testified that he was personally aware of 'a lot of'  recent narcotics smuggling taking place through the Alpine area that  was destined for locations in Kansas. Since the truck    in question bore a Kansas license plate, this information weighs in  favor of Agent Graham's reasonable suspicion determination.  

 Finally,  as there is no indication in the record that Jacquinot, the truck's  only passenger, caused any suspicion, the factor regarding the  number, appearance, and behavior of the passengers is the sole  factor that does not support the agents' reasonable suspicion  determination. See (stating that not every Brignoni-Ponce factor need weigh in favor of reasonable suspicion and that an  officer need not eliminate all reasonable possibility of innocent  travel before conducting an investigatory stop). 

 Viewing  the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and  considering the totality of the circumstances, the district court  did not err in denying Jacquinot's motion to suppress, as the border  patrol agents' stop of the truck in which he was riding was based on  reasonable suspicion that the truck's occupants were engaged in  illegal activity. See ; . 


 

 b.  Upward adjustment for weapon possession 

 Jacquinot  also contends that    the district court erred in applying 's  two-level upward adjustment for possession of a weapon in connection  with a drug trafficking offense. Jacquinot argues that although  there were two unloaded handguns in the truck, the Government failed  to prove that it was not clearly improbable that he possessed those  handguns in connection with his drug offense. 

   The district court's decision to apply is a factual determination reviewable for clear error. .  provides for a two-level increase in the offense level for a drug  trafficking offense 'if a dangerous weapon (including a  firearm) was possessed.' 'The government has the burden of  proof under of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a temporal and  spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking  activity, and the defendant.' (internal quotation and citation omitted). 'Applying this  standard, the government must provide evidence that the weapon was  found in the same location where drugs or drug paraphernalia    are stored or where part of the transaction occurred.' Id. (internal quotation and citation omitted). The adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless the  defendant establishes that it was clearly improbable that the weapon    was connected with the offense. See  ,  comment. (n.3); . 

   A PSR is generally considered sufficiently reliable to be considered  by the trial court as evidence in making the factual determinations  required by the sentencing guidelines. .  In the present case, the district court adopted the PSR's findings  that 286.44 pounds of marijuana were found in a toolbox in the bed  of the truck in which Jacquinot was riding and that two unloaded  handguns were found in the cab of the truck. Jacquinot does not  contest these findings and even acknowledges that ammunition was  also found in the truck. Accordingly, the district court did not  err, clearly or otherwise, in finding that was applicable because there was a temporal and spatial relationship  between Jacquinot, the    guns, and his drug trafficking offense. See (applying adjustment where shotgun found in truck of vehicle used to transport  drugs), vacated  on other grounds by  ; (applying adjustment where gun found under the seat of car used in attempted  theft of narcotics). 

 There  is no merit to Jacquinot's argument that because he was not charged  with the offense of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking  offense and because Agent Snodgrass' memo stated that the guns were  not loaded, no attempt was made to use them, and there was no  evidence that the guns had been intended for use against law  enforcement officers, it is clearly improbable that the guns were  connected to his drug trafficking offense.   For purposes of the adjustment, 'it is not necessary for possession of the weapon .  . . to be sufficiently connected with the crime to warrant  prosecution as an    independent firearm offense.' .  And it is not material that the guns were not loaded; 2D1.1(b)(1) is  an added punishment for drug offenders who heighten the danger of  drug trafficking by possessing a dangerous weapon, and the mere  presence of a gun, loaded or not, can escalate the danger. See .  Finally, it does not matter whether Jacquinot actually used or  intended to use the guns in his drug-trafficking offense; the  pertinent fact is that 'they could have been so used.' (emphasis added). Jacquinot's sentence must therefore be affirmed. 


 III.  CONCLUSION 

 Based  on the foregoing, we affirm Jacquinot's conviction and sentence.

 ROBERT  M. PARKER, Circuit Judge, specially concurring. 

 The  absurdity of our jurisprudence, as it relates to the southern border area of Texas,  is well illustrated by Judge Wiener's dissent in  .  In addition to the factual scenarios    he lists in his dissent that we have judicially blessed, we can now  add spending five seconds at a Stop sign prior to turning left, and  driving 20 mph through a school zone when the blinking light was  off. 

 The  stop was seventy-five miles from the border, well beyond our  artificial fifty mile limit. There is no evidence that the    truck had crossed the border. The articulated reason of lead  car/following car had been dispelled, a fact which decreases the  relevance that at some point (undisclosed for security purposes)  within the park two vehicles passed a sensor. The officers also  mentioned the highly suspicious slowing within the speed limit as  the defendants were being followed and the Kansas license plate on  the vehicle. This last point had particular significance for one of  the officers, since at one point in his career he made a case  involving a Kansas destination. 

 I  find no rational or principled basis upon which to conclude that  either reasonable suspicion or probable cause existed that would  justify the stop in this case. I choose to specially concur because  I recognize that at this point in time, in this circuit, a dissent  would be an exercise in futility. I remain hopeful    that at some point in time, the hysteria regarding the ill-fated war  on drugs and its impact on the will subside and the rule of reason will again prevail.
