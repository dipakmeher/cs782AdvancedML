 A  jury convicted Salvador Jaquez of conspiracy to transport an  undocumented alien within the United States in violation of and ,  and transporting or attempting to transport an undocumented alien  within the United States in violation of .  The district court imposed concurrent sentences of 36 months of  imprisonment on each count, followed by three years of supervised  release. On appeal, Jaquez challenges the sufficiency of the  evidence on both counts. We AFFIRM. 

 FACTUAL  AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 

 A  superseding indictment charged Jaquez with one count of conspiracy  to transport and one count of transporting undocumented aliens.  Jaquez pled not guilty on both counts. The following evidence  was    presented at his trial before a jury. 

 The  United States Border Patrol has two checkpoints near Laredo , Texas .  A driver can avoid both checkpoints by driving    through the OKM Ranch and the neighboring Briscoe Ranch. 

 Border  Patrol Agent George Reyna testified that at 5:30 a.m. on August 30,  2022, a Border Patrol camera captured an image of a pickup truck  with a gooseneck trailer on the road leading to the OKM Ranch. Agent  Reyna alerted field agents, and Border Patrol Agent Joshua Cayton  immediately responded. Based on recent alien  smuggling activity, Agent Cayton believed the truck's likely exit point was  the Briscoe Ranch main road. While en route to the main road, Agent  Cayton received another camera notification at approximately 5:40  a.m., indicating a vehicle was entering the Briscoe Ranch from the  OKM Ranch. 

 Agent  Cayton approached the gate leading to the Briscoe Ranch main road  with his lights out. After opening the gate, he parked out of sight  and returned to the gate on foot. Soon, two other Border Patrol  agents arrived. At approximately 6:00 a.m., Agent Cayton saw  headlights and confirmed it was the truck from the camera images.  Agent Cayton detained the driver while the other agents    detained the front-seat passenger and Jaquez, who was sitting in the  back seat. The truck driver and front-seat passenger were aliens in  this country illegally. The agents discovered 60 more undocumented  aliens hidden in the gooseneck trailer. Jaquez was the only United  States citizen in the truck. 

 Agents  searched the truck and found two grocery bags full of cell phones on  the back seat. They also found bolt cutters, a black bag containing  a flashlight, and master locks with keys, which were used to secure  the gates on the OKM and Briscoe Ranch roads. 

 Homeland  Security Investigations promptly assumed control of the  investigation. At trial, Homeland Security Special Agent Michael  Rhea testified about his video interview with Jaquez. Jaquez said he  was a United States citizen living in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Jaquez  asserted he was a day laborer who routinely crossed into Laredo for  work and on August 30, 2022, he had prearranged a job moving hay.  Jaquez maintained the truck with the trailer picked him up at a  plaza in Nuevo Laredo between 5:45 and 6:00 a.m. to take him to the  day job. 

 During  the interview, Jaquez later changed his story. In his second  version, Jaquez explained that, after    being picked up by the truck with the trailer, he was taken to a  house in south Laredo, where the driver was replaced. Jaquez  allegedly fell asleep after the truck proceeded along the ranch road  until he was awakened by the Border Patrol agents. Jaquez told Agent  Rhea he was unaware of the people hidden in the trailer. 

 Agent  Rhea testified that Jaquez, during the same interview, changed his  story a third time. In his third rendition, Jaquez told Agent Rhea  the truck that picked him up at the Nuevo Laredo plaza was not the  truck he was arrested in; he instead was picked up by a blue Ford  F-150 truck with four occupants. The F-150 proceeded to the house in  south Laredo. Two of the F-150's occupants got into the trailer and  another took the driver's seat of the truck in which Jaquez was  arrested. The driver allegedly instructed Jaquez to sit in the back  and pay attention to the routes so that he could learn them. 

 According  to Agent Rhea's testimony, Jaquez changed his story a fourth time  during the interview. The Government played this portion of the  video interview for the jury. In the video, Jaquez asserted he saw  the last four aliens get into the trailer but admitted he did not  ask any    questions or walk away because he wanted to get paid. Jaquez  confessed he knew the truck was heading north towards San  Antonio     and was attempting to evade the Border Patrol checkpoints. 

 During  the interview, Agent Rhea searched Jaquez's cellphone with his  consent. One contact in the cellphone was Tony Primo. The number and  time of calls involving Primo stood out to Agent Rhea as consistent  with that of similar alien  smuggling cases. Agent Rhea also found WhatsApp audio messages between Jaquez  and Edgar Descargas. 'Descargas' means 'unloading'  in English. Agent Rhea testified he did not know the legal name of  that person, but speculated Jaquez saved the contact as 'Edgar  Unloading,' which indicated Descargas was connected to the  smuggling operation. The messages were translated to English for  trial. 

 On  August 28, 2022, Jaquez asked Descargas through WhatsApp whether  Descargas had a schedule 'to load the box,' 'because  Descargas said that tomorrow there was going to be a box loaded.'  Descargas told Jaquez he would have the information the next day.  Jaquez responded, 'he needed to be ready/sure so that he  could also move the people.' 

 On  cross-examination, Agent Rhea acknowledged    there was no other data related to alien  smuggling in Jaquez's cellphone. Jaquez's criminal history consisted only of a  juvenile arrest. To Agent Rhea's knowledge, Jaquez did not operate  the truck, open any of the gates, or have a large sum of cash on him  at the time of his arrest. 

 Agent  Rhea further explained that, in reviewing the WhatsApp messages  between Jaquez and Descargas, it appeared that Descargas was the one  providing Jaquez with work. Descargas, however, contacted Jaquez  again through WhatsApp about a job one week after Jaquez's arrest,  while Jaquez was in custody. Agent Rhea admitted this contact did  not make sense if Descargas was involved in the smuggling operation.  After the Government rested, the district court denied Jaquez's  motion for a judgment of acquittal. 

 The  jury found Jaquez guilty on both counts. At sentencing, the district  court adopted the presentence report and stayed within the United  States Sentencing Guidelines by imposing 36-month concurrent  sentences and three years of supervised release. Jaquez timely  appealed. 

 DISCUSSION 

 Jaquez  moved for a judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence at  the close of the Government's case.   This court reviews his    challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence de  novo because it has been properly preserved for appeal. . 

   'The jury's verdict is afforded great deference on appeal.' (quotation marks and citation omitted). This court examines 'the  evidence in the light most favorable to the Government with all  reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in support of the  verdict.' (citation omitted). 'In determining whether the evidence was  sufficient to support the conviction, the question is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of  the crime beyond reasonable doubt.' (emphasis in original) (quotation marks and citations omitted).  Because of the 'highly deferential standard of review,'  this 'court only ascertains whether the jury made a rational  decision, not whether the jury correctly determined guilt or  innocence.' (quotation marks and citations omitted). 

     On appeal, Jaquez argues there was insufficient evidence to convict  him on both counts: conspiracy to transport undocumented aliens and  transporting undocumented aliens. We address each count separately. 


 I.  Conspiracy to transport undocumented aliens 

   To convict Jaquez of conspiracy to transport undocumented    aliens, the Government must demonstrate Jaquez knowingly,  intentionally, and voluntarily '(1) agreed with one or more  persons (2) to transport an undocumented alien inside the United  States (3) in furtherance of his unlawful presence (4) knowingly or  in reckless disregard of the fact that the alien's presence in the  United States was unlawful.' .  'The elements of conspiracy may be established solely by  circumstantial evidence, including the presence, association, and  concerted action of the defendant with others.' (quotation marks and citation omitted). 

 Jaquez  challenges only the first element — whether there was sufficient  evidence of an agreement. Jaquez argues there is no evidence he  agreed to transport aliens with another person. He acknowledges the  evidence of the driver's instruction for him to get in the back seat  of the truck and pay attention to the routes so he could learn them.  Jaquez contends, however, he never agreed to the driver's  instruction or to driving in the future and, thus, no conspiracy  existed. 

 Jaquez  does not account for the additional evidence against him, such as  his differing versions of events and messages with Descargas  regarding loading 'boxes' and moving    people. Jaquez confessed that he knew about the aliens in the  trailer and that the driver was attempting to evade the Border  Patrol checkpoints. Further, a Border Patrol agent found Jaquez in  the back seat of the truck with various incriminating items. 

 This  circumstantial evidence, taken together, sufficiently supports a  finding that Jaquez entered into an agreement to transport aliens.  We thus conclude a rational juror could have determined the  Government sufficiently demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that  Jaquez knowingly, intentionally, and voluntarily participated in a  conspiracy to transport undocumented aliens. 


 II.  Transporting undocumented aliens 

   To convict Jaquez for transporting undocumented aliens, the  Government had to prove: 

 (1)  an alien entered or remained in the United States in violation of  the law, (2) Jaquez transported the alien within the United States  with intent to further the alien's unlawful presence, and (3)  Jaquez knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the alien was  in the country in violation of the law. 

 .  Jaquez challenges only the second element. 

 Jaquez  argues that because he was not a driver and there was no evidence  demonstrating he exercised    any measure of control over the smuggling operation or the aliens,  he could not be convicted for a transporting offense. He  acknowledges that a panel of this court held that a passenger can  properly be convicted of transporting undocumented aliens. .  He argues his case is distinguishable because was decided under a different standard of review, namely, the  manifest-miscarriage-of-justice standard. . 

     In ,  a panel of this court concluded that, although most transporting  convictions involve a defendant who is the driver, '  is obviously broader than this common fact pattern.' Id.    Further, 'our cases reflect that the transporting element  turns on the defendant's control of the means of transportation,'  not his status as a driver. Id. The applicable standard of review did not affect this reasoning. We  adopt the reasoning of and conclude that on the proper facts, a passenger may be convicted  of transporting undocumented aliens. 

 The  evidence here sufficiently supports the jury's finding that Jaquez  exercised control over the means of transportation. Jaquez's  conversation with Descargas indicated he was coordinating the  transport and needed to obtain additional people to help complete  the    job for Descargas. Jaquez was found with the locks and keys for the  ranch road gates as well as the aliens' cell phones, supporting some  control or supervision of the operation. Further, Jaquez, in his  interview with Agent Rhea, demonstrated his knowledge of the  operation details. The jury, examining the evidence cumulatively,  could properly infer beyond a reasonable doubt that Jaquez satisfied  the transporting element and had some control over the operation. 

 AFFIRMED.
