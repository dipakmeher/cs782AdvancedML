 Abdullah  Yusuf was stopped by Border Patrol near Laredo , Texas ,  while smuggling 84 illegal aliens in a trailer. A jury convicted him  for trafficking aliens. On appeal, Yusuf argues the jury had  insufficient evidence. We disagree and affirm. 

 I. 

 On  March 19, 2021, Abdullah Yusuf pulled a flatbed trailer north on  Interstate    35. At a Border Patrol checkpoint near Laredo , Texas ,  a police dog alerted to Yusuf's vehicle. Further inspection revealed  that the trailer carried 84 illegal aliens inside several wooden  crates arranged in a rectangle and covered by a tarp. The Government  charged Yusuf with transporting illegal aliens within the United  States for financial gain and conspiring to do the same. , , . 

 Yusuf  waived his Miranda rights. He then    told Homeland Security Inspector Juan Carlos De Arcos that he was  headed to Dallas and didn't know what he was hauling. Yusuf claimed  a brokerage company named "You Brokerage" paid him $2,700  to haul the load. He said he arrived at the pickup location—a lot  on Auburn Road in Laredo—between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. On his  telling, Yusuf then backed his trailer to the loading dock, took his  tractor to the Flying J to wait while the trailer was being loaded,  returned an hour later, hooked his tractor to the now-loaded  trailer, received a bill of lading ("BOL"), and started  for Dallas. 

 Agent  De Arcos testified that Jamco International, Inc. owned the Auburn  Road lot and used it for storing empty trailers. The lot had a  "loose gravel" surface. The lot had no warehouse, loading  equipment, or loading dock. A representative from Jamco testified  that the lot only had one entrance, locked daily from 9:00 p.m. to  9:00 a.m. 

 Agent  De Arcos also testified that his investigation into "You  Brokerage" revealed no record of the company's existence. The  phone number Yusuf provided for "You Brokerage" didn't  work. Agent De Arcos could not find a logbook in Yusuf's tractor. He  did, however, find the BOL    for the load in question. It identified USA Trucking—not Yusuf's  company, Steel on Steel Transportation—as the carrier, contained a  trailer number that didn't match Yusuf's trailer, included an origin  address other than Auburn Road, and listed a delivery address in  North Carolina, not Dallas. Agent De Arcos testified that the BOL  appeared to have been forged by doctoring an older one, also found  in the tractor. 

 Two  of the aliens found in Yusuf's trailer also testified. Both  acknowledged that they paid several thousand dollars to be smuggled  into the United States. Whereas Yusuf said the trailer was loaded at  the Jamco "loose gravel" lot, both aliens said the trailer  was parked on hard ground made of "cement or concrete,"  and one said the loading occurred "in an alley," not an  open lot. And whereas Yusuf claimed he took his tractor to the  Flying J while the trailer was being loaded, one of the aliens  testified that he walked past the tractor right before climbing into  the trailer. Once all 84 aliens were loaded, the truck left roughly  two minutes later. 

 Yusuf  moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government's  case. The district court denied it. Yusuf then took the  stand.    He denied ever agreeing to transport aliens and claimed he didn't  know there were people in his trailer. Yusuf reaffirmed the  statement he had given to Agent De Arcos months earlier. He said the  "You Brokerage" representative told him to pick up the  load at the Auburn Road lot. When he arrived, Yusuf was told to  leave his trailer and that he would receive    a call when the load was ready. Yusuf left the lot, walked his dogs,  and waited about 45 minutes to an hour. When Yusuf returned to the  lot, he found his trailer loaded and turned around so that it was  facing the exit. He hooked up to the trailer (which he said takes  roughly 5 minutes), ensured the straps were secure, received the BOL  from a person working at the lot, then traveled north on I-35 toward  Dallas. 

 The  defense rested, but Yusuf didn't renew his motion for a judgment of  acquittal. The jury convicted Yusuf on all counts, and the court  sentenced him to 70 months' imprisonment and 3 years' supervised  release. Yusuf timely appealed. 

 II. 

 We  (A) explain the particularly exacting standard that applies to  unpreserved sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges. Then we (B) hold  that Yusuf fails to clear that nearly insurmountable hurdle.    

 A. 

   "The standard of review for insufficiency-of-the-evidence  claims depends on whether the claims were preserved." .  For preserved sufficiency claims, we give "substantial  deference to the jury verdict" and affirm if "a rational  jury could have found each essential element of the offense beyond a  reasonable doubt." (en banc) (quoting ); see  also ("We do not consider whether the jury correctly determined  innocence or guilt, but whether the jury made a rational  decision."). And in doing so, we "view the evidence in  the light most favorable to the verdict and draw all reasonable  inferences from the evidence to support the verdict." (quotation omitted). That's a high bar. See (describing the standard as "highly deferential"); (describing the standard as placing a "heavy thumb on the scale  in favor of the verdict"). 

 Yusuf,  however, didn't preserve his sufficiency challenge. See ("When the defendant moves for judgment of acquittal at the  close of the government's case in chief, and defense evidence is  thereafter presented but the defendant fails to renew the motion at  the conclusion of all of the evidence, he waives objection to the  denial of his earlier motion." (quotation omitted)).    So Yusuf faces an even greater hurdle.   We review unpreserved claims under the familiar four-factor  plain-error standard: 

 First,  there must be an error or defect . . . . Second, the legal error  must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute.  Third, the error must have affected the appellant's substantial  rights, which in the ordinary case means he must demonstrate that it  affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. Fourth and  finally, if the above three prongs are satisfied, the court of  appeals has the discretion to remedy the error—discretion which ought to be exercised only if  the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public  reputation of judicial proceedings. 

 (quotation omitted). 

        Meeting all four prongs of plain-error review is "difficult, as  it should be." Ibid. (quotation omitted). But where, as here, the unpreserved claim is a  sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, the standard of review is  doubly difficult. Cf.,  e.g., ("Double deference is doubly difficult for a petitioner to  overcome, and it will be a rare case in which an ineffective  assistance of counsel claim that was denied on the merits in state  court is found to merit relief    in a federal habeas proceeding."). That's because the  "substantial deference" that we generally afford verdicts  combines with the "exacting" plain-error standard to  create an exponentially more difficult standard of review than  either one standing alone. ; see  also .  Indeed, a sufficiency error satisfies the second prong of  plain-error review only when "the record is devoid  of evidence pointing to guilt." (quotation omitted). Mere insufficiency doesn't cut it. Rather, the  movant must prove that the evidence was so completely, obviously,  and unbelievably inadequate that allowing the verdict to stand would  be a "shocking" and "manifest miscarriage of  justice." (quotation omitted). These combined standards are tantamount to the  eye of a virtually impassable needle. Yusuf cites no case where a  defendant threaded it. 

 B. 

 This  case will not be the first. 

   To obtain a conviction under ,  the Government must prove the accused "(1) agreed with one or  more persons (2) to transport an undocumented alien inside the  United States (3) in furtherance of his unlawful presence (4)  knowingly or in reckless disregard of the fact that the alien's  presence in the United States was unlawful." ; see  also  .  And    for a substantive transportation offense, the Government must prove  that (1) "an alien entered or remained in the United States in  violation of the law," and the accused (2) "transported  the alien within the United States with intent to further the  alien's unlawful presence," (3) "knew or recklessly  disregarded the fact that the alien was in the country in violation  of the law," and (4) acted for financial gain. ; see  also  , ; . 

 Yusuf  argues that the Government failed to prove that he knew illegal  aliens were in his truck, that he agreed with anyone to transport  illegal aliens, or that he sought to further their unlawful presence  in the United States. But viewing the evidence presented at trial in  the light most favorable to the verdict—and drawing all reasonable  inferences in support of the verdict—Yusuf doesn't come close to  meeting the doubly deferential plain-error-sufficiency burden. 

 Start  with knowledge.    "Knowledge may be—and often must be—shown by  circumstantial evidence." (per curiam) (collecting cases); see  also (noting that a defendant's mental state is "almost always  proved by circumstantial evidence" (quotation omitted)).  Consciousness of guilt can be inferred from a    host of factors, including control over the vehicle where the  illegal object or alien is concealed, conflicting or inconsistent  statements, implausible explanations, incomplete answers to  questions by law enforcement, demeanor, and lack of concern or  surprise when the illegality    is discovered. E.g., ; (per curiam). In the alien-smuggling context, we've also considered additional factors such as whether  the defendant is the sole driver or occupant of the tractor and if  it would be reasonable to place the fate of a lucrative voyage in  the hands of an unwitting party. E.g., ; ; (per curiam). 

 At  Yusuf's trial, the Government presented a mountain of evidence  indicating that Yusuf knew he was hauling illegal aliens. Yusuf was  the sole driver and occupant of the truck in the trailer of which 84  illegal aliens were discovered; that alone is probative of  knowledge. .  The jury also heard abundant evidence that Yusuf's story lacked  credibility. (inferring knowledge from less-than-credible explanations). Just to  name some of the inconsistencies: Yusuf testified the trailer was  loaded in an open lot, but one of the aliens said he boarded the  trailer in an alley; Yusuf testified his trailer was    loaded on a gravel surface, but both aliens said the surface was  concrete; Yusuf testified he pulled his trailer up to a loading  dock, but Jamco's Auburn Road location doesn't have a loading dock;  Yusuf testified he pulled into the Auburn Road lot around midnight,  but the Auburn Road lot was locked daily from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. The  jury was entitled to discredit Yusuf's testimony and conclude that  he knew exactly what he was doing. ("The jury retains the sole authority to weigh any conflicting  evidence and to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses."  (quotation omitted)); see  also (per curiam) ("The jury heard the testimony of Campos regarding  his alleged lack of knowledge of the alien's presence and apparently  did not find it to be credible."). 

 Lastly  with respect to knowledge, the Government presented evidence  indicating Yusuf was present when the aliens were loaded onto the  trailer. One of the aliens testified that he walked past Yusuf's  tractor before climbing onto the trailer. And once he boarded the  trailer, the truck left roughly two minutes later. This directly  contradicts Yusuf's sworn statement that he took his tractor to the  Flying J while the trailer was being loaded and    that upon his return it took at least five minutes to hook his  tractor back onto the trailer before commencing the journey north. ("False exculpatory statements may be used not only to impeach,  but also as substantive evidence tending to prove guilt."). 

 Yusuf  further argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he  conspired with anyone to transport aliens. But "given the  testimony of the aliens regarding the coordination of the trip, the  other persons involved in the loading and transport, and the  inference that Yusuf knew he was transporting aliens, the evidence  also reasonably supports an inference that Yusuf agreed to  participate in the organized smuggling operation." .  Further, the jury was entitled to infer "from the large  quantity and value of aliens, and the difficulty of secreting  them in the trailer, that others were involved in the scheme." .  Yusuf himself even acknowledged that he agreed with at least one  other individual—the fictional "You Brokerage" broker—to  transport the load. 

     Finally, Yusuf argues that the Government didn't produce sufficient  evidence that he sought to further the illegal aliens' presence in  the United States. That's wrong for    several reasons. First, and most obviously, Yusuf "was found to  be attempting to drive aliens away from the border while they were  hidden in a trailer—passing through a Border Patrol checkpoint at  an hour described as a peak time for smuggling." .  Next, Yusuf was carrying a false BOL for the journey. Together, the  testimony of Agent De Arcos and USA Trucking Senior Vice President  George Henry supported the inference that Yusuf himself forged the  BOL to facilitate his drive north. Lastly, the jury was well in  bounds to find that Yusuf's financial prospects were contingent on  the aliens' safe passage into the United States. Both aliens who  testified said they agreed to pay at least $10,000 to be smuggled  into the United States. If all 84 aliens paid even close to that  sum, then Yusuf's journey north had significant financial stakes.  "The jury could have reasonably inferred that Yusuf would  not have been entrusted with such a valuable cargo if he had not  been knowledgeable and involved in the alien-smuggling scheme." . 

 Yusuf  fails to prove the trial evidence was insufficient—much less that  it was so obviously inadequate that it would satisfy our doubly  deferential standard of review.    

 AFFIRMED. 


 


 E nd  of Document   

 1  USA  Trucking Senior Vice President George Henry testified that the older  BOL was from a trip undertaken by Yusuf for USA Trucking. Henry  further testified that the trailer identified in both BOLs had not  been in Texas since February 3, 2021. Moreover, USA Trucking had no  records of anything recently being shipped to Bessemer, North  Carolina—the address on the newer BOL.
