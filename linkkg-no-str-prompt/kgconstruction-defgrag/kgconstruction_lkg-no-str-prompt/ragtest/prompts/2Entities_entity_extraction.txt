-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entitys attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
 
3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
 
4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Text: 
On March 12, 2024, a smuggling operation took place using a well-established route through the remote desert roads and a river crossing near Laredo, Texas. The operation started in Nuevo Laredo, where individuals were gathered before moving towards Houston, Texas. The final checkpoint before crossing was near Tucson, Arizona.

Example 02:
Entity_types: ROUTES, LOCATION
Text:
On June 18, 2023, an intercepted smuggling operation revealed a major trafficking corridor through the Arizona desert, commonly used for unauthorized crossings. The operation, led by cartel members using a fleet of modified trucks, followed a route that started in Hermosillo, Mexico, and passed through the Sonoran desert before reaching a staging point in Nogales, Mexico. From there, individuals attempted to cross via a remote canyon near the U.S.-Mexico border. Federal agents detained three individuals suspected of organizing the movement. Authorities noted that the final destination for most travelers was Phoenix, Arizona.
